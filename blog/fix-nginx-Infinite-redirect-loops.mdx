Encountering endless redirects between HTTP and HTTPS on your Nginx website? This common issue, often called an "infinite redirect loop," can be frustrating. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56092994/how-can-i-fix-chrome-infinite-redirect) This guide provides a step-by-step solution to configure Nginx for smooth and secure redirection.

## Understanding Infinite Redirect Loops

The goal of HTTP to HTTPS redirection is simple: automatically route `http://yourdomain.com` requests to `https://yourdomain.com`.  However, misconfiguration can create a cycle where Nginx repeatedly redirects between HTTP and HTTPS, preventing users from accessing the page and resulting in the dreaded "Too Many Redirects" browser error.

## Solving Infinite Redirect Loops in Nginx

This guide provides a solution to configure Nginx correctly, eliminating frustrating redirect loops. [checkout infinite redirect for next js](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/issues/1436) 

### 1. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

The primary cause of infinite redirect loops is often improper HTTP to HTTPS redirection.  Configure your Nginx configuration file as follows:



```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    # Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

*   `listen 80;`: Nginx listens on port 80 for HTTP traffic.
*   `server_name yourdomain.com;`: Specifies the domain to redirect.
*   `return 301 https://$host$request_uri;`:  Performs a permanent (301) redirect to the HTTPS version, preserving the original URL path. [community.cloudflare](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/infinite-redirect-loop/164210) 

### 2. Configure the HTTPS Server Block

This server block handles HTTPS requests on port 443 and utilizes your SSL certificates:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/yourdomain.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/yourdomain.key;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

*   `listen 443 ssl;`: Nginx listens on port 443 for HTTPS traffic.
*   `ssl_certificate` and `ssl_certificate_key`:  Paths to your SSL certificate and private key.  **Ensure these paths are correct.**
*   `location /`: This block handles incoming HTTPS requests. `try_files` attempts to serve the requested file or returns a 404 error if not found.




### 3. Preventing Redirect Loops: The Crucial Step

The key to preventing loops is to ensure that redirection occurs *only* from HTTP to HTTPS.  Avoid configuring redirects within the HTTPS server block.  Keep the HTTP block solely for redirection and the HTTPS block for serving secure content. [nife.io](https://nife.io/solutions/One%20Click%20Deployment) - Web development reference


### 4. Test and Reload Nginx

Before restarting Nginx, test your configuration:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If no errors are reported, reload Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### 5. Clearing Browser Cache (If Necessary)

If the "Too Many Redirects" error persists, clearing your browser's cache and cookies might resolve the issue.

## **Conclusion**

Setting up an HTTP to HTTPS redirect in Nginx is pretty simple, but getting it right is key to avoiding endless redirect loops. The best way to do it is by setting up two separate server blocksâ€”one to catch HTTP traffic and send it to HTTPS, and another to handle secure HTTPS connections.  

This way, your users get a seamless and secure browsing experience without unnecessary redirects slowing things down.
