## Introduction

By combining [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), you can take use of both frameworks' strengths: Next.js provides a quick, server-rendered frontend, while Django offers a stable backend. In this tutorial, we'll create a basic book review application in which Next.js retrieves and presents book data that Django delivers over an API.

After completing this tutorial, you will have a functional setup in which Next.js renders dynamic book reviews by using Django's API.

## Why Use Next.js with Django?
:white_check_mark: **Fast Rendering**: Next.js supports [SSR (Server-Side Rendering)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation), improving performance.

:white_check_mark: **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is handled by Django, and UI rendering is done by Next.js.


:white_check_mark: **Scalability**: Since each technology can grow on its own, future improvements will be simpler.

## Step 1: Setting Up Django as the Backend

### 1. Install Django and Django REST Framework
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install Django and DRF
pip install django djangorestframework
```

### 2. Create a Django Project and App
```bash
django-admin startproject book_api
cd book_api
django-admin startapp reviews
```

### 3. Configure Django REST Framework
In `settings.py`, add REST framework and the `reviews` app:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'rest_framework',
    'reviews',
]
```

### 4. Define the Book Review Model
In `reviews/models.py`:

```python
from django.db import models

class BookReview(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    review = models.TextField()
    rating = models.IntegerField()
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

Run migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a Serializer and API View

In `reviews/serializers.py`:
```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import BookReview

class BookReviewSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = BookReview
        fields = '__all__'
```

In `reviews/views.py`:
```python
from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView
from .models import BookReview
from .serializers import BookReviewSerializer

class BookReviewListView(ListAPIView):
    queryset = BookReview.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookReviewSerializer
```

Add a URL route in `reviews/urls.py`:
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import BookReviewListView

urlpatterns = [
    path('reviews/', BookReviewListView.as_view(), name='book-reviews'),
]
```

Include this in `book_api/urls.py`:
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('reviews.urls')),
]
```

Run the server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now access book reviews at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/reviews/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/reviews/).

---

## Step 2: Setting Up Next.js as the Frontend

### 1. Install Next.js
In a new terminal, create a Next.js app:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest book-review-frontend
cd book-review-frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Fetch Data from Django API
Modify `pages/index.js` to fetch book reviews:
```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export default function Home() {
    const [reviews, setReviews] = useState([]);
    
    useEffect(() => {
        fetch("http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/reviews/")
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => setReviews(data));
    }, []);
    
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Book Reviews</h1>
            <ul>
                {reviews.map(review => (
                    <li key={review.id}>
                        <h2>{review.title} by {review.author}</h2>
                        <p>{review.review}</p>
                        <strong>Rating: {review.rating}/5</strong>
                    </li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### 3. Start the Next.js Server
Run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see book reviews fetched from Django!

---

## Step 3: Connecting Frontend and Backend

Since Django and Next.js run on different ports (8000 and 3000), we need to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

### 1. Install Django CORS Headers

In Django, install CORS middleware:
```bash
pip install django-cors-headers
```

Add it to `settings.py`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS += ['corsheaders']
MIDDLEWARE.insert(1, 'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware')

CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:3000",
]
```

Restart Django:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Now, Next.js can fetch data without CORS issues!

## Conclusion
You've created a book review app by successfully integrating Next.js with Django. What we did was as follows:

1. Use the Django REST Framework to install Django.
2. To offer book reviews, an API was developed.
3. Created a frontend using Next.js to show reviews.
4. Set up CORS to allow front-end and back-end communication.


This setup provides a solid foundation for full-stack development. You can now extend it with [Django Authentication](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/), a database, or advanced UI components!
