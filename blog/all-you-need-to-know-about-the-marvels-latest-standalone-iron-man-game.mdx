_Marvel Entertainment and Motive Studio have joined forces to create an all-new Marvel's latest standalone Iron Man video game. Marvel released the ‘Marvel Future Revolution' game last month, and now Motive Studio in Montreal is currently working on a new single-player, third-person action-adventure Marvel's latest standalone Iron Man game._

### Introduction

Motive Studio's next project has been revealed by Electronic Arts: a single-player third-person action game centered on Marvel Comics character-turned-cinematic franchise protagonist [Iron Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man). This information comes from an EA blog post, which is generally a low-key approach to announcing a game based on one of the world's most popular superheroes. However, it is 2022, and game announcements are no longer limited to summer gaming festivals or end-of-year awards displays. They are also recruitment tools intended to attract talent in a highly competitive industry. EA concluded its presentation by explicitly inviting developers to visit the company's recruitment portal.

### Unique Single-Player Adventure Game

The game will be directed by Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy executive producer Olivier Proulx, according to EA. The project will also be led by industry veterans Ian Frazier (who designed Star Wars: Squadrons), Malenn Lumineau, and JF Poirier.

The Marvel Future Revolution game is being developed in collaboration with Marvel Games, which has recently been on a mission to get as many companies as possible working with characters licensed from comic books. Under different publishing labels, Insomniac Titles, Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal, and now Motive Studios have all collaborated with the Disney-owned gaming business to make huge budget games. It will have an "original storyline" inspired by Iron Man's background.

That implies the result will be akin to Marvel's Future Revolution game and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: the character will be roughly similar to the film version of the character, but Motive Studio will delve into the character's past for a unique tale and environment.

### Motive Studio's Inspiration

Motive Studio has always been an outlier in EA's developer roster. It was formed by Jade Raymond but ultimately absorbed the employees of BioWare Montreal and found itself functioning as a support company on games such as Star Wars Battlefront II and Criterion Games' racing titles. The team there started out working on the single-player Star Wars game that would destroy Visceral Games.

Following a significant change in studio leadership (Raymond left in 2018), the studio began work on two major projects: an open-world game co-named "Gaia" with crafting/building components in an internet world that was momentarily taunted in 2020 before being canceled in 2021, and Star Wars Squadrons, a mid-sized passion project that was eventually released. It has most recently been working on the remake of Dead Space.

The announcement of an Iron Man game today appears to signal that Motive is finally finding its footing as a firm making [independent games](/blog/top-cloud-servers-to-opt-for-to-skyrocket-your-gaming-experience/). The termination of Gaia (which had been in production for six years) and changes in studio leadership suggested that EA wasn't sure what it wanted the Montreal-based firm to be.

There's also something intriguing about the studio canceling a multiplayer accessible trade skill and discovery game that would be an original intangible asset (entirely unexpected in a world in which every business is rushing for a metaverse product), but approving a big-budget single-player based on a licensed character.

### More Marvel Characters

The characters may appear in the next Iron Man game, even if it is a single-player one. We could even see Peter Parker web-slinging his way through the game, as he and Tony have a strong friendship, but information on the scenario and the characters in the game are scarce at this time. We don't even know what the title is yet. If this is a solo narrative, it might be about the Armoured Avenger going up against the bad guys on his own.

"It's an honor and a joy to be able to create a video game based on one of the most recognizable Super Heroes in entertainment today," stated Olivier Proulx in a statement to Marvel. "We have a fantastic opportunity to tell a new and distinct tale that we can call our own." Marvel is urging us to try new things. We have a lot of freedom, which keeps the crew engaged."

### Final Thought

All of the best Marvel creations, throughout our history—comics, cartoons, films, games—are when the best talent comes to Marvel and they're teamed up with characters they love and want to say something with, also to bring something new. And it's Marvel's tradition to give them that freedom to tell their story. Similar to the Marvel Future Revolution. It's like they're the chef. What is the meal you want to make? Oh, you can make that awesome. Here are all the ingredients.

As Motive Studios' Iron Man is still in the pre-production stage, there is currently no release window.
