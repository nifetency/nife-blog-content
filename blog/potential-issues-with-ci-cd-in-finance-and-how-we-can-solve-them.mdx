Creating a functional Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline involves a series of successful events. Still, common issues may arise during the setup and use of the pipeline.

Due to the complexity of a CI/CD pipeline, many common issues can occur. These can range from simple to fix problems to deceptive issues that are difficult to troubleshoot. Many people find these issues can arise quickly and be challenging to resolve. Let us discuss some issues related to CI/CD in finance.

# **Various Issues with CI/CD in the Finance Sector**

Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) are popular practices in software development that involve continuously integrating code changes and deploying them to a production environment. At the same time, these practices have been widely adopted in many industries. They can [present challenges in the finance sector](/blog/top-10-data-security-challenges-for-financial-services/) due to the sensitive nature of financial data and the strict regulations that govern it.

### **1. Security**

One potential issue with CI/CD in finance is security. Financial data is often sensitive and confidential and must be protected from unauthorized access or breaches. However, frequent code deployments in a CI/CD pipeline can increase the risk of vulnerabilities being introduced into the system. This can be mitigated by implementing strict security controls and testing procedures throughout the pipeline. But this can be a significant challenge for organizations that are not well-equipped to handle it.

### **2. Performance Issues**

The CI/CD pipeline aims to deliver software and code updates quickly through automation. However, if not done properly, it can lead to performance issues in the software. One solution is implementing an automated testing system to detect potential performance issues, such as inefficient code, and alert developers for further evaluation. This can prevent the release of poorly performing software builds to customers.

### **3. Communication**

When working within a CI/CD pipeline, it is common to collaborate with multiple individuals, potentially divided into teams with specific responsibilities. One of the main challenges in CI/CD is effective communication, particularly when issues arise during software deployment. Clear and timely communication is essential for resolving problems quickly.

Effective communication is crucial in the CI/CD pipeline, as failure to properly convey information, such as an error in an automated build test, can lead to serious consequences. This is just one example of why communication is vital in this field.

### **4. Complexity of CI/CD**

Finally, organizations may also face challenges with managing the complexity of their CI/CD pipeline. With multiple teams and departments working on different parts of the system, it cannot be easy to coordinate and manage all the different components. This can lead to delays in deployments and an increased risk of errors, which can be costly and time-consuming.

Solving the issues associated with CI/CD in the finance sector requires a comprehensive approach that addresses security, compliance, system stability and reliability, and complexity management. By taking a proactive approach and implementing the right measures, organizations can successfully implement CI/CD practices while maintaining the security and compliance of their financial systems. Additionally, Organizations should consider investing in a good CI/CD tool specifically designed to meet the needs of financial institutions to support compliance, security, and risk management.

### **Implementation of security controls**

First and foremost, organizations must prioritize security in their [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) pipeline. This can be achieved by implementing strict security controls and testing procedures throughout the pipeline.

An effective way to maintain a high level of security in your pipeline is to implement a monitoring system that covers all sections and to quickly detect and lock down any irregularity. Additionally, minimizing the amount of sensitive information transmitted through code and using code analysis tools to identify and replace vulnerable sections can also enhance security.

To ensure maximum security in your pipeline, it is important to closely monitor access to all components and keep it as restricted as possible.

### **Regular performance checking**

To comply with regulations, organizations should perform regular audits and assessments of their CI/CD pipeline to ensure that it complies with the laws and regulations that apply to their industry. They should also seek advice from legal and compliance experts to identify the specific requirements they need to meet.

Performance testing allows for easy and efficient comparison of build performance. It can identify bottlenecks and bugs that can significantly decrease performance. Additionally, load simulation testing should also be a crucial part of the performance testing process. To be effective, it is important to have a robust set of tools for this method.

### **Implement a strategy to check stability and reliability**

Organizations should implement additional testing and quality assurance procedures to ensure system stability and reliability throughout the pipeline. This can include unit testing, integration testing, and performance testing, as well as monitoring and logging systems to detect and respond to any issues that may arise. Additionally, organizations should implement a rollback plan that allows them to quickly restore the system to a stable state in case of an emergency.

### **Management of the complexity of their CI/CD pipeline**

Finally, organizations must take steps to manage the complexity of their CI/CD pipeline. This can include implementing a centralized configuration management system and establishing clear communication channels between different teams and departments. By implementing a governance model, organizations can ensure that all teams are working together towards the same goal and that there is a clear chain of command in case of issues or conflicts.

CI/CD pipelines heavily rely on automation, but there are aspects that are not automated, such as communication, collaboration and teamwork. These three factors are crucial for the success of the pipeline, and optimizing communication and transparency is essential for a smooth workflow.

## **Conclusion**

While CI/CD practices can bring significant benefits to organizations regarding efficiency and speed, they can also present significant challenges in the finance sector. Organizations must take a proactive approach to [address these challenges](/blog/7-proven-methods-to-address-the-devops-challenges/). Some solutions to the problems include implementing strict security controls and testing procedures, complying with regulations, ensuring system stability and reliability, and managing the complexity of the pipeline. With the right approach, organizations can successfully implement CI/CD practices while maintaining the security and compliance of their financial systems.
