# What is Cloud Gaming?

Cloud gaming is a type of internet or cloud gaming service that allows you to play video games over remote cloud gaming servers. Cloud [gaming eliminates the need](/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-marvels-latest-standalone-iron-man-game/) to download the game to your local device; instead, it streams straight to your device and remotely plays the game from the cloud.

## How does Cloud Gaming function?

Cloud gaming services execute it on their servers, which are outfitted with high-end graphics RAM [(Yates et al., 2017)]. The game will then respond to your orders, and each frame will be broadcast directly to your smartphone. If you have a solid internet connection, the end-user experience is fairly comparable to traditional gaming.
