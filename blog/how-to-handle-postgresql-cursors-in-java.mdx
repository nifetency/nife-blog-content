It could be a little difficult to use PostgreSQL cursors, especially if you need to use them in Java applications.  If you've worked with relational databases and experimented with PL/SQL (Oracle's procedural language), you might recognise cursors.  On the other hand, PostgreSQL handles and returns cursors in a different way.


This blog post will show you how to programmatically retrieve cursor data, interact with PostgreSQL cursors in Java, and give some real-world examples.


## What's a Cursor Anyway?

Using a cursor, which is essentially a pointer, you can get rows from a query one at a time or in batches without putting the entire result set into memory all at once.  Think of it as a way to handle large datasets without overtaxing your computer.

 In a database, you often get all of the results at once when you run a query.  By chunking the data or fetching rows at a time, a cursor can handle large amounts of data, improving performance and resource management.

 It becomes interesting when you want to handle it in Java since a PostgreSQL method can return a cursor.


## Setting Up a Cursor in PostgreSQL

<img src={require('./img/2808316.jpg').default} alt="Step-by-step guide on setting up a cursor in PostgreSQL with example code" width="500" height="350"/>
<br/>

Lets start with a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) function that returns a cursor. Well assume you have a table called `employees` with columns like `employee_id`, `first_name`, and `salary`. Heres a basic function that opens a cursor for this table:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_employee_cursor()
RETURNS REFCURSOR AS $$
DECLARE
    emp_cursor REFCURSOR;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cursor FOR
    SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
    FROM employees;
    RETURN emp_cursor;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This function `get_employee_cursor` opens a cursor for a simple `SELECT` query on the `employees` table and returns it.

## How to Fetch the Cursor Data in Java

To communicate with the database in Java, we can utilize [JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-jdbc/). Because the function that returns the cursor is a callable function, you must use a `CallableStatement` when working with cursors in PostgreSQL. Here's how to accomplish that:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class CursorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Database connection details
        String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database";
        String user = "your_user";
        String password = "your_password";

        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)) {
            // Enable transactions (required for cursors in PostgreSQL)
            connection.setAutoCommit(false);

            // Step 1: Call the function that returns a cursor
            try (CallableStatement callableStatement = connection.prepareCall("{ ? = call get_employee_cursor() }")) {
                callableStatement.registerOutParameter(1, Types.OTHER); // Cursor is of type "OTHER"
                callableStatement.execute();

                // Step 2: Retrieve the cursor
                ResultSet resultSet = (ResultSet) callableStatement.getObject(1);

                // Step 3: Iterate through the cursor and display results
                while (resultSet.next()) {
                    int employeeId = resultSet.getInt("employee_id");
                    String firstName = resultSet.getString("first_name");
                    double salary = resultSet.getDouble("salary");

                    System.out.printf("Employee ID: %d, Name: %s, Salary: %.2f%n", employeeId, firstName, salary);
                }

                // Close the ResultSet
                resultSet.close();
            }

            // Commit the transaction
            connection.commit();

        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## Breaking Down the Code

<br/>

### Connection Setup
- We connect to PostgreSQL using the `DriverManager.getConnection()` method.
- `connection.setAutoCommit(false)` is crucial because cursors in PostgreSQL work within a transaction. By disabling auto-commit, we ensure the transaction is handled properly.

### Calling the Cursor-Returning Function
- We use a `CallableStatement` to execute the function `get_employee_cursor()`, which returns a cursor. This is similar to calling a stored procedure in other databases.
- We register the output parameter (the cursor) using `registerOutParameter(1, Types.OTHER)`. In JDBC, cursors are treated as `Types.OTHER`.

### Fetching Data from the Cursor
- Once the cursor is returned, we treat it like a `ResultSet`. The cursor essentially acts like a pointer that we can iterate over.
- We loop through the result set using `resultSet.next()` and retrieve the data (like `employee_id`, `first_name`, and `salary`).

### Commit the Transaction
- Since the cursor is part of a transaction, we commit the transaction after were done fetching and processing the data.

## When Would You Use Cursors in Java?

### Managing Big Data Sets
It could take a lot of memory to load all of your records at once if you have a lot of themâ€”millions, for instance.  By retrieving the data in chunks via a cursor, you may conserve memory.


### Performance Optimization
For large result sets, it is usually more efficient to fetch data in batches or row by row, which lessens the strain on your database and application.


### Streaming Data
Using cursors to get and process data in real time is a smart strategy when working with streams.

## Final Thoughts

Although using Java cursors in PostgreSQL might seem a bit more difficult than in Oracle, massive data sets can be efficiently managed with the right approach.  By utilising `CallableStatement` to obtain the cursor and iterating over the result set, you may make full use of Java's cursors without encountering memory or performance issues.

 Regardless of whether you're working with large datasets or need more exact control over how data is pulled from the database, cursors are a helpful addition to any PostgreSQL toolbox.  Just be aware that, unlike Oracle, PostgreSQL requires the explicit retrieval of cursor data, but it is easy to comprehend and effective once you do.
