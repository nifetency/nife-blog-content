<br/>



Disaster recovery in cloud computing is an essential component of business continuity planning. A business's disaster recovery plan is an in-depth plan outlining the steps that must be taken in the case of catastrophic events to restore the company's essential IT infrastructure, software, and data.

Whether natural (such as floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes) or man-made (such as cyber-attacks and system failures), incidents may strike at any moment and for various reasons. Organizations need to have a disaster recovery in cloud computing to guarantee that they can swiftly and easily restore their mission-critical information technology (IT) infrastructure and data in the event of a catastrophe, therefore mitigating the damage to their operations, reputation, and bottom line.

A disaster recovery plan typically includes the following components:

### **1. Risk Assessment:**

A comprehensive evaluation of the potential hazards that may lead to interruptions in the organization's IT infrastructure and information.

### **2. Recovery Time Objective (RTO):**

Determining the duration the organization can tolerate the unavailability of its essential IT systems and information.

### **3. Recovery Point Objective (RPO):**

A well-defined establishment of the timeframe within which the organization must restore its data, ensuring that the information is as current as feasible.

### **4. Backup Strategy:**
