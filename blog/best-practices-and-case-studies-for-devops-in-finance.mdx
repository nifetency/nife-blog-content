_**DevOps in finance** is one of the most innovative development practices in the financial sector._

Moving quickly in response to market developments is essential if you want your firm to remain relevant in the current digital world. This is especially true for the financial services sector. In the financial sector, sustaining services while meeting client expectations is more important than ever.

And, DevOps technologies, methods, & concepts have developed as the mechanism to drive this change from pattern recognition to the discovery of new income streams. It covers governance, risk, security, and compliance methods and enhances the quality of application releases. In this article, we will discuss some best practices and case studies for implementing **DevOps for finance services.**

### **What is DevOps?**

DevOps is the combination of the words "development" and "operations." It is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. It aims to improve software development, deployment speed, quality, and efficiency. In the financial industry, DevOps can be especially valuable for improving the performance and scalability of financial systems and reducing the risk of errors and outages.

### **Best Practices for DevOps in Finance**

 **1. Increase in Collaboration and Communication between Teams**

One of the key best practices for implementing **DevOps in finance** is to focus on collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. This can be achieved by creating cross-functional teams that include development and operations members and implementing tools and processes that facilitate communication and collaboration. For example, an issue-tracking system like Jira or GitHub can help development and operations teams stay on top of bugs and feature requests. In contrast, a chat tool like Slack or Microsoft Teams can help teams stay in touch and share information quickly.

 **2. Automation Process**

Another best practice for implementing **DevOps in finance** is to focus on automation. Automation can reduce the risk of errors and outages and improve software development and deployment speed and efficiency. Automation tools such as Jenkins, Ansible, and Puppet can help automate repetitive tasks and reduce manual errors. Automation can also help with testing and deployment by automating the testing process and deploying code to production quickly and efficiently.

 **3. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) are also important practices for **DevOps in finance**. CI/CD is a methodology that emphasizes the continuous integration of code changes and delivery of new features to production. This can be achieved by implementing a continuous integration server like Jenkins or Travis CI and automating the testing and [deployment process](/blog/simplify-your-deployment-process-cheap-cloud-alternative/).

**4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

Infrastructure as code is another important practice for **DevOps in finance**. Infrastructure as code is a methodology that enables the management of infrastructure as code rather than as manual configurations. This can be achieved using tools like Terraform and Ansible, which enable the provisioning and management of infrastructure as code. This can help reduce the risk of errors and outages and improve the scalability and performance of financial systems.

 **5. Monitoring and Logging**

Monitoring and logging are also important practices for **DevOps in finance**. Monitoring and logging help to ensure that financial systems are working properly and that any issues are identified and addressed quickly. Monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana can help monitor system performance and resources. In contrast, logging tools such as Elasticsearch and Kibana can help analyze log data.

### **Various Case Studies about DevOps**

**1. JPMorgan Chase:**

[JPMorgan Chase](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/) is one of the largest financial institutions in the world and has implemented [**DevOps for financial services**](/blog/why-multi-cloud-is-the-first-choice-of-financial-services-to-become-cloud-native/) to improve the speed, quality, and efficiency of software development and deployment. They have implemented a continuous integration and delivery pipeline, automated testing, and deployment. They have also implemented infrastructure as code and have a dedicated team for monitoring and logging. This has helped them to reduce the risk of errors and outages, as well as improve the scalability and performance of their financial systems.

**2. Barclays DevOps Adoption**

In 2015, Barclays announced that DevOps was being used as part of its [digital transformation](/blog/digital-transformation-ways-bfsi-can-thrive-in-dynamic-technological-advancements/) strategy. At the moment, Barclays is in charge of managing payments, which make up over 30% of the UK's GDP. The leadership team credited DevOps at Barclays with significantly reducing the complexity of their programs, which allowed them to lower delivery risk and, in turn, improve the quality of their services. Developer satisfaction and code quality increased as a consequence.

 **3. Capital One:**

Capital One is a financial services company that has implemented **DevOps for financial services** improvements such as performance and scalability. They have implemented a continuous integration and delivery pipeline, automated testing, and deployment. They have also implemented infrastructure as code and have a dedicated team for monitoring and logging. This has helped them to reduce the risk of errors and outages, as well as improve the scalability and performance of their financial systems.

 **4. DevOps the Lunar Way**

An experience that shows Kubernetes doesn't require a large organization to be used. The large monolithic application was divided into more manageable microservices as the first step in their cloud-native DevOps journey. Ansible, Terraform, and Jenkins were used to spin up these microservices and deploy them as a single unit.

They then suddenly began encountering some of the microservices' scaling problems. They thus did not gain in any way from microservices.

They thus began seeking solutions to this complexity by reorienting their attention from machine-oriented to application-oriented design. They didn't care where the containers were operating and instead picked Kubernetes and AWS as the abstraction layer, which allowed them to manage microservices and unleash their velocity. Additionally, they chose Kubernetes for its security features and to describe how the apps should function. With the help of Kubernetes, they currently manage over 80 microservices in production.

### **Conclusion**

Companies in the financial services industry are under a lot of pressure to embrace sophisticated and demanding software development methodologies that satisfy stringent corporate and regulatory standards. With DevOps, the financial sector can deploy software faster than ever to keep up with demand and outperform the competition they face.
