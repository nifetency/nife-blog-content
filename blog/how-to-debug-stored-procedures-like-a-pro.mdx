## Step 1: Catch the Error (Without Losing Your Cool)
Oracle includes built-in features for error detection. Use `RAISE NOTICE` to print error messages.

```sql
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Error in procedure %: %', SQLERRM;
        RETURN 'F';  -- Failure indicator
```

This prints errors directly to TOAD's Output window.

## Step 2: Test with Real Data (Not Just Theoretical Inputs)

<br/>


Use actual data, including edge cases like invalid IDs or `NULL` values, to properly debug your [stored procedure](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_stored_procedures.asp).

## Step 3: Get Interactive with TOAD's Debugger

TOAD provides a powerful interactive debugger:

- **Open SQL Editor**: Load your stored procedure.
- **Set Breakpoints**: Click on line numbers where issues might exist.
- **Start Debugging**: Right-click the procedure name and select `Debug`.
- **Watch Variables**: Monitor values in real time in the `Watch` window.

## Step 4: Check Execution Plan

For performance issues, use TOAD's `Explain Plan` feature:

```sql
EXPLAIN PLAN FOR
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'Active';
SELECT * FROM TABLE(DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY);
```

This helps identify bottlenecks and optimize queries.

## Step 5: Logs, Logs, and More Logs

Ensure important details are logged for future debugging:

```sql
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Procedure started for user: ' || user_id);
```

## Step 6: Have a Code Review (or Just Ask Google)

If stuck, seek help from **Google**, **Stack Overflow**, or a colleague for fresh perspectives.

## TL;DR: Debugging Like a Boss

- Use `RAISE NOTICE` to print errors.
- Test with **real data**.
- Step through the code using **TOAD Debugger**.
- Analyze the **execution plan** for slow queries.
- Log errors for **detailed tracking**.
- **Google it** (really, it works!).

Debugging stored procedures may not be fun, but with these tips, you'll solve issues faster and with less frustration.
