**I Automated My Social Media Posting — So I Can Actually Enjoy My Evening**

**Or: how I taught n8n to handle my content hustle like a virtual assistant on steroids.**

---

## Why I Did This

If you're anything like me, managing social media feels like a full-time job you didn’t apply for.

I found myself copying captions from Google Docs, downloading images, opening apps, pasting everything, uploading, re-uploading, clicking around — for **each** platform. Every. Single. Time.

That’s when I thought: _“Can I automate this mess and just control everything from a Google Sheet?”_

Spoiler: Yes. You totally can.

If you're new to automation, [n8n's getting started docs](https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/installation/) are a great place to begin.

## What I Built

Using **n8n**, I created a workflow that does the following — all by itself:

- Looks at a Google Sheet for scheduled posts  
- Finds the image in Google Drive  
- Posts the content to **Instagram**, **LinkedIn**, and **X (formerly Twitter)**  
- Updates the Sheet so I know what’s been posted  

And the best part? I don’t even have to be awake for it to run.

## The Stack

This is a no-code/low-code build. Here’s what I used:

- **n8n** for automation  
- **Google Sheets** as my content planner  
- **Google Drive** to store my media  
- **Facebook Graph API** to post on Instagram  
- **Twitter API**  
- **LinkedIn API**  

Looking to integrate more platforms? Check out [n8n’s list of integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/) — it supports hundreds of apps.

## How It Works

### 1. **The Schedule Trigger**  
It all starts at 7 PM. n8n checks if there’s any post with `Status = Scheduled`.

### 2. **Pull from Google Sheets**  
If there's something to post, it grabs:  
- The filename of the image  
- The caption (called “Links” in my sheet)  
- The row number (to update later)

### 3. **Search & Download the Image**  
Using the filename, it finds the matching image in a shared Google Drive folder and downloads it.

### 4. **Post It Everywhere**  
Then, using different APIs:  
- It tweets the caption on **X**  
- Posts the image + caption to **LinkedIn**  
- Uploads the image and publishes it on **Instagram** via the **Facebook Graph API** (yep, it’s a 2-step process)

### 5. **Update the Sheet**  
Once done, it changes the `Status` to `Uploaded` — so nothing gets posted twice.

## My Sheet Looks Like This

| Topics   | File name   | Links (caption)          | Status    |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Weekend  | beach.png   | “Weekend vibes”          | Scheduled |
| Code Life| code.jpeg   | “New dev blog out now”   | Uploaded  |

## Things I Learned

- Instagram’s API is wild. You’ll need a Facebook Business Page, a connected IG account, and a developer app. But once it's set up, it’s smooth.  
- OAuth tokens will test your patience. Save them in n8n credentials and be kind to your future self.  
- Debugging in n8n is a joy. You can click on any node, see the exact data flowing through, and fix stuff on the fly.  



---

## What’s Next

- Add OpenAI to auto-generate captions (maybe even suggest hashtags)  
- Log post metrics in Notion  
- Make it support image **carousels** and **videos**

<br/>

1. **Sign up for n8n**: It’s free to start, and you can self-host or use their cloud version.  
2. **Create a Google Sheet**: Set up your content planner with columns for topics, file names, captions, and status.  
3. **Connect Google Drive**: Store your images in a shared folder.  
4. **Set Up n8n Workflow**: Use the Google Sheets, Google Drive, and social media nodes to build your automation.  
5. **Test It**: Run the workflow manually first to make sure everything works as expected.  
6. **Schedule It**: Set the trigger to run at your preferred time (like 7 PM) so it posts automatically.  
7. **Sit Back and Relax**: Enjoy your evenings while n8n does the heavy lifting.  
8. **Iterate**: Keep improving your workflow as you learn more about n8n and your social media needs.
