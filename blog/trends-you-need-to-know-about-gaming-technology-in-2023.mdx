# New Computer Gaming Platforms

Let's start with PC [gaming as the first on our list of game industry](/blog/gaming-industrys-globalisation-best-edge-platform/) trends in 2023. While Steam has long been the most popular PC gaming platform, there are several games development companies on the scene that might dethrone it.

GOG is gaining prominence as a digital distribution platform due to its large collection of classic and current releases. Epic Games Store, the video game developer behind Fortnite, is another one to watch, along with Origin, UPlay, and others. Another trend to keep an eye on is the online gaming platform Roblox, which has resulted in a significant increase in independent games.

## Gaming on the cloud

Do you remember when you had to actually purchase a game from a store? Or do you want to download it from a famously sluggish server? Or spend hundreds of dollars updating your PC console? With a plethora of games suddenly available to watch in real-time, those days will be numbered, all thanks to the latest [gaming technologies and cloud gaming servers](/blog/the-intersection-of-gaming-and-the-metaverse-cloud-gaming-servers/).

Although [cloud gaming servers](/blog/quick-guide-why-are-cloud-servers-better-for-gaming/) is not a new gaming trend for 2023, it is improving year after year, allowing end users to play without device-dependent delays. If you haven't previously heard of PlayStation Now, Xbox [Cloud Gaming](/blog/playing-edgy-games-with-cloud-edge-cloud-gaming-services/), Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or other cloud gaming servers, you will in 2023!

## Exciting new games, as well as revivals and reboots

From first-person shooters (FPS) to role-playing games (RPG), and everything in between, there are a plethora of new games to look forward to in 2023.

Here are some of our favorites, which include a brand-new space-inspired RPG and several couldn't reboots and remakes.

**Starfield:** The games development company Bethesda's first RPG in 25 years, Starfield transports players to outer space on an epic mission to solve humanity's biggest mystery.

**Street Fighter 6:** The first game in the Street Fighter franchise in seven years, it will be published on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and PC.

**Remake of Dead Space:** In the third-person survival horror game Dead Space, you battle dangerous reanimated corpses. In comparison to 2008 original, the games development company improved gameplay, as well as revamped graphics, characters, and landscapes.

## Fitness gaming is a surprisingly new genre.

Say bye to the times when gaming was reserved for individuals who did not enjoy being active. Not only may eSports become an Olympic sport, but there are now games by video game developers that make you sweat - and everyone seemed to be quite interested in getting into fitness gaming. We agree!

We've seen the Peloton cycle with built-in gaming, as well as a slew of lesser-known but equally steamy fitness games by various games development companies. Zombie Run, which will make even non-runners want to put on their sneakers, Until You Fall, which will have you sweating with all of its full-body motions, and Ring Fit Adventure, which includes a flexible resistance hoop, are several to keep an eye on.

## Games centered on women

Think again if you thought gaming was exclusive for men. Women made up more than 40% of gamers in the United States in 2020 and approximately 45% of players in Asia - and they're on the increase. This increase in female gamers is due to a variety of factors, including social ties, competitiveness, and challenge.

With more women than ever behind the console, video game developers and games development companies are paying attention. On the market currently are a plethora of games created by female video game developers that are ideal for women. Child of Light (combat game), Tomb Raider (classic), and Niche are among our favourites (Nintendo Switch).
