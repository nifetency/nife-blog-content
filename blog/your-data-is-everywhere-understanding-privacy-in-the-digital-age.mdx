## The Deceptive Methods Used to Gather Your Data

### 1. Cookies: Not Only for Food
One of the first things that happens when you visit a website is that a small text file known as a cookie is saved to your device. It is comparable to the digital version of a party name tag. Cookies enable websites to remember your personal information, preferences, and even the items you have added to your shopping cart.  
Cookies don't end there, though. Additionally, they trace your online browsing patterns across many websites, which is how those eerie customised advertisements follow you around. For instance, hours after viewing a new pair of shoes at an online retailer, advertisements for those shoes may appear on other websites. That is how cookies collect your information and forward it to advertising.

### 2. Social Networks: The Data Free-For-All
Let's be honest: sharing your images and status updates on social media is just one aspect of your online persona. Every click, like, share, and even the amount of time you spend staring at a post is tracked by social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.  
All of this data is gathered in order to create a comprehensive profile of you, a digital representation that forecasts your habits, interests, and preferences. This enables businesses to provide you with highly tailored advertisements and information, but it also means that your data is continuously being collected for financial gain.  


### 3. Location Monitoring: Your Current Location and Past Locations
You may be surprised to learn that your phone always knows where you are. Many apps ask for your location in order to provide functions like weather updates, fitness tracking, and restaurant recommendations in your area. However, your device might continue to share your location with these apps in the background even when you're not using them.  
Your phone's GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are continuously collecting data about your location in addition to the apps you've installed. It is easy to understand why privacy experts are so concerned when you combine this with location-based services and apps.

### 4. Your Searches: What Do You Actually Want?
That search history is saved each time you ask Siri a question, look up a video on YouTube, or Google something. By using this information, search engines may better tailor their results and show you advertising that are relevant to your interests. It doesn't end there, though; one of the most comprehensive data sources for creating a profile of yourself is your search history.  
The search phrases you enter can reveal a lot about you to a firm, even if you aren't communicating with them directly. It's similar to leaving a breadcrumb trail that data brokers and advertising are keen to follow.

## Why Do They Monitor All of This Information?
It's time to find out why your data is being taken now that we know how.  
Money is the short solution. Data collecting is the primary source of revenue for the great majority of free websites and apps, including Facebook, Instagram, and even Google. They can create thorough profiles of you and people similar to you by gathering and examining your data. Advertisers can now target you with more relevant advertising that have a higher chance of making you click, buy, or interact. Advertisers are therefore prepared to shell out a lot of money for this extremely focused advertising area.  
Consider this: you are most likely the product being marketed if you are utilising a free service.

## Advice on Safeguarding Your Privacy
"Well, if everything is tracked, what can I do to protect my privacy?" is a question you may have. Thankfully, you can regain some control by doing the following:

### 1. Empty your cookies
When you first visit many websites, you may choose whether to accept or refuse cookies. Examine these settings, and if you're worried, turn off all cookies that aren't necessary. Periodically clearing your cookies is another option. You can delete cookies in the settings of most web browsers; simply navigate to the privacy or history area and delete surfing data.  
If you want to be extra safe, you may also use a browser like [Brave](https://brave.com/), which by default bans trackers and cookies, making it more difficult for advertisers to follow you around.

### 2. Make use of a VPN
Your internet traffic can be hidden behind a Virtual Private Network (VPN). It encrypts your data and hides your IP address by rerouting your connection via a distant server. As a result, websites and advertisers are unable to trace your location or learn about your surfing preferences.  
VPNs are particularly helpful when accessing sensitive data online or utilising public Wi-Fi. But not all VPNs are made equal, so make sure to pick a trustworthy provider that doesn't sell your information.

### 3. Restrict Sharing on Social Media
Consider the content you actually post on social media. Posting your most recent vacation photos or your current location may seem innocuous, but these details can be used to build a profile of your activities. To ensure that only individuals you trust can view your posts, think about restricting the personal information you provide and modifying your privacy settings.  
Additionally, pay attention to the permissions you give apps on your computer or phone. Do you really need to allow Instagram access to your contacts or camera, for example? You can make sure you're not sharing more than is required by routinely checking your app's permissions.  


### 4. Employ private browsing or incognito mode.
Use the Incognito or Private Browsing mode on your browser if you must surf without leaving a trace. By doing this, you stop your browser from saving cookies, search history, and other browsing information. It's a simple method of avoiding leaving traces on your local computer, but it doesn't make you totally anonymous.

### 5. Make use of two-factor authentication and strong passwords.
A strong password is no longer sufficient. For every account, choose a strong, one-of-a-kind password, and if at all possible, turn on two-factor authentication (2FA). By forcing you to verify your identity through an authenticator app or text message, this offers an additional degree of security.  


## Conclusion: One Can Choose to Be Private
In the digital age, convenience frequently comes at the expense of privacy, and data reigns supreme. The continual surveillance, whether it's recording your every action or selling your information to ads, can make it seem impossible to escape. However, with the correct resources and a little awareness, you may regain some control and safeguard your privacy.  

So, next time you browse the web, think twice before you click "Accept" on that cookie banner. Privacy isn't something you should just give awayâ€”it's something you should actively protect.  
After all, your data is everywhere, but that doesn't mean it has to be up for grabs.
