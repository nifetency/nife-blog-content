Cloud Cost Management refers to the idea of effectively controlling your cloud expenditures. It typically entails evaluating your cloud's expenses and reducing those that are unneeded in the best cloud computing platforms. There are no shortcuts when it comes to expense management. Make solid planning, get the fundamentals right, and include your teams so they realize the gravity of the problem. Cloud cost management has emerged as a critical subject for cloud computing technology and Multi-Access Edge Computing, as well as a new need for every software firm.

### Cloud Cost Management Tools Used in the Best Cloud Computing Platforms

**Cloud Cost Optimization:** Organizations frequently overspend with their cloud service providers and want to reduce expenses so that they only pay for whatever they need. They must reduce cloud-related expenses.

**Transparency in Cloud Expenses:** Cloud costs should be visible at all levels of the company, from executives to engineers. All participants must be able to grasp cloud costs in their situation.

**Cloud Cost Governance:** Guardrails should be put in place regarding cloud computing technologies expenses, basically building systems to guarantee costs are kept under control.

### Best Practices for Cloud Cost Management

You may apply the best practices for cloud cost management given below to create a cloud cost optimization plan that relates expenses to particular business activities such as Multi-Access Edge Computing and Cloud Computing Technology, allowing you to identify who, what, why, and how your cloud money would be spent.

**Underutilized Resources Should Be Rightsized or Resized**

Making sure your clusters are properly scaled is one of the most effective methods to cut costs on your [cloud infrastructure](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-cloud-infrastructure). Implementing tips may assist you in optimizing costs and lowering your cloud expenditures. It can also suggest improvements to instance families. Continuous variables do more than just lower cloud expenses; it also assists in cloud optimization or making the most of the services you pay for.

**Unused Resources Should Be Shut Down**

A cloud management platform/tool may detect idle, unallocated, and underused virtual machines/resources. Idle resources are ones that were formerly operational but are now turned off, raising expenditures. Purchased but never used unallocated or underused virtual machines (VMs) [(Adhikari and Patil, 2013)]. You spend for what you order or buy, not what you utilize with any [cloud platform](/blog/hybrid-cloud-platform-for-devops-developers-devops-as-a-service/).

**Setup AutoStopping Rules**

AutoStopping Rules are a strong and dynamic resource orchestrator for non-production demands. Some of the major benefits of implementing AutoStopping Rules into your cloud services are as follows:

- Detect idle moments automatically and shut down (on-demand) or terminate (spot) services.
- Allow workloads to execute on fully coordinated checks for signs while stressing over spot disruptions.
- Calculate idle times, especially throughout the working time.
- Stop cloud services without optimizing compute; just start/stop operations are supported.

**Detect Cloud Cost Inconsistencies**

A technique for detecting [cloud cost anomalies in the best cloud computing platforms](/blog/cloud-computing-platforms-free-cloud-server/) can be used to keep cloud expenses under control. Cost anomaly detection indicates what you should be looking for to keep your cloud expenses under control (save money). An alert is generated if your cloud costs significantly increase. This assists you in keeping track of potential waste and unanticipated expenditures. It also records repeating occurrences (seasonality) that occur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

**Set a Fixed Schedule for Uptime or Downtime**

Configure your resources' uptime and downtime schedules. For that duration, you can set downtime for the specified resources. Your selected services will be unavailable during this time, allowing you to save money. This is especially useful when many teams are using/using the same resources as in Multi-Access Edge Computing.

**Create Budgets and Thresholds for Teams and Projects**

Make your budgets and get reminders when your expenses surpass (or are projected to exceed) your budget. You can also specify a budget percentage barrier based on actual or expected costs. Setting budgets and boundaries for various teams and business units can help to reduce cloud waste significantly.

**Establish a Cloud Center of Excellence Team**

A Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) is comprised of executives (CFO and CTO), an IT Manager, an Operations Manager, a System Architect, an Application Developer, a Network Engineer, and a Database Engineer [(AlKadi et al., 2019)]. This group may assist you in identifying opportunities for cloud cost minimization.

### "Cost Impact of Cloud Computing Technology" Culture

Every important feature should have a Cloud Cost Impact checkbox. This promotes a mindset and attitude among application developers and the cross-functional team that expenses are just another boundary condition to be optimized over time and make your platform the best cloud computing platform.

### Conclusion

Consider how your company is now working in the cloud. Is your company's Cloud Operating Model well-defined? Is your company using the best cloud computing platforms? Are you using Multi-Access Edge Computing? Cloud cost management does not have to be difficult, but it does need a disciplined strategy that instills strong rightsizing behaviors and consistently drives insights and action through analytics to reduce your cloud bill. And here is where Nife's cloud computing technology shines.
