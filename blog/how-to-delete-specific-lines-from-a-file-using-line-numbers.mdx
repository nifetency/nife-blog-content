When you're working with text filesâ€”be it config files, logs, or source codeâ€”you may need to delete specific lines based on their line numbers. This might sound intimidating, but itâ€™s actually quite easy once you know which tool to use.

In this post, weâ€™ll walk through several methods to remove lines using line numbers, using command-line tools like `sed`, `awk`, and even Python. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, thereâ€™s a solution here for you.

## The Basic Idea

<img src={require('./img/6437614.jpg').default} alt=" " width="500" height="450"/>
<br/>

To delete a specific range of lines from a file:

1. Identify the **start line** and **end line**.
2. Use a tool or script to remove the lines between those numbers.
3. Save the changes back to the original file.

Letâ€™s break this down by method.

## 1. Using `sed` (Stream Editor)

<br/>

`sed` is a command-line utility thatâ€™s perfect for modifying files line-by-line.

### Basic Syntax
```bash
sed 'START_LINE,END_LINEd' filename > temp_file && mv temp_file filename
```

- Replace `START_LINE` and `END_LINE` with actual numbers.
- `d` tells `sed` to delete those lines.

### Example
To delete lines 10 through 20:
```bash
sed '10,20d' myfile.txt > temp_file && mv temp_file myfile.txt
```

### With Variables
```bash
START_LINE=10
END_LINE=20
sed "${START_LINE},${END_LINE}d" myfile.txt > temp_file && mv temp_file myfile.txt
```

## 2. Using `awk`

`awk` is a pattern scanning tool. Itâ€™s ideal for skipping specific lines.

### Syntax
```bash
awk 'NR < START_LINE || NR > END_LINE' filename > temp_file && mv temp_file filename
```

### Example



```bash
awk 'NR < 10 || NR > 20' myfile.txt > temp_file && mv temp_file myfile.txt
```

This prints all lines **except** lines 10 through 20.

## 3. Using `head` and `tail`

Perfect when you only need to chop lines off the start or end.

### Example
Delete lines 10 to 20:
```bash
head -n 9 myfile.txt > temp_file
tail -n +21 myfile.txt >> temp_file
mv temp_file myfile.txt
```

- `head -n 9` gets lines before line 10.
- `tail -n +21` grabs everything from line 21 onward.

## 4. Using `perl`

`perl` is great for more advanced file manipulation.

### Syntax
```bash
perl -ne 'print unless $. >= START_LINE && $. <= END_LINE' filename > temp_file && mv temp_file filename
```

### Example
```bash
perl -ne 'print unless $. >= 10 && $. <= 20' myfile.txt > temp_file && mv temp_file myfile.txt
```

- `$.` is the line number variable in `perl`.

## 5. Using Python

For full control or if youâ€™re already using Python in your workflow:

### Example
```python
start_line = 10
end_line = 20
with open("myfile.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

with open("myfile.txt", "w") as file:
    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        if i < start_line - 1 or i > end_line - 1:
            file.write(line)
```

Python is especially useful if you need to add logic or conditions around what gets deleted.

<br/>

There are plenty of ways to delete lines from a file based on line numbers:

- Use **`sed`** for simple, fast command-line editing.
- Choose **`awk`** for conditional line selection.
- Go with **`head`/`tail`** for edge-case trimming.
- Try **`perl`** if youâ€™re comfortable with regex and quick one-liners.
- Opt for **Python** when you need logic-heavy, readable scripts.
