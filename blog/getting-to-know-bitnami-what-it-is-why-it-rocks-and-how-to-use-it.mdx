If you’ve ever tried setting up a web application, you know how messy it can get—installing servers, configuring databases, dealing with software versions. That’s where **Bitnami** steps in to make your life easier.

In this post, we’ll break down what Bitnami is, why it’s so well-loved, and how you can start using it—whether you’re testing apps locally or deploying to the cloud.

## What is Bitnami? All-in-One App Stack for Local & Cloud Deployments

<br/>

Think of Bitnami as your all-in-one app launcher. It provides **pre-configured software stacks**—basically bundles of apps like WordPress, Joomla, or Moodle, with all their required dependencies baked in.

You can run Bitnami on:
- Your local computer (Mac, Windows, Linux).
- Cloud providers like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Azure**.
- Containers using **Docker** or **Kubernetes**.

Each Bitnami stack includes the app, a web server (like Apache), a database (like MySQL), and scripting languages (PHP, Python, etc.). It’s ready to go out of the box.
