If you've spent any time in the world of DevOps, SRE, or modern software delivery, you've heard the word **Kubernetes** (or just **K8s**). But beyond the buzzword status, Kubernetes is a powerhouse system for managing containerized workloads at scale with flexibility, resiliency, and automation baked in.

In this blog, we'll break down the core components of Kubernetes, explain how they work together under the hood, and help you understand what actually runs inside a Kubernetes cluster.

## What Is Kubernetes?

<img src={require('./img/5159616.jpg').default} alt="What is Kubernetes - Developer understanding Kubernetes architecture and container orchestration" width="550" height="450"/>
<br/>

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system originally developed by Google and now maintained by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/). Its primary job is to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Think of Kubernetes as the **operating system for your cloud-native applications** â€” providing the abstraction and control layer for apps running in containers (like those built with Docker, Podman, etc.).

## High-Level Architecture: Control Plane vs. Node Components

A Kubernetes cluster is split into two main categories of components:

- **Control Plane** â€“ the brain of the cluster
- **Node Components** â€“ the workers that run containers

Let's break them down.

---

###  Control Plane Components

The Control Plane manages the overall state of the cluster. It makes decisions (e.g., scheduling, reacting to failures) and exposes APIs for cluster interaction.

#### 1. kube-apiserver

- The front door of the cluster. Every request â€” from kubectl, Helm, CI/CD pipelines â€” hits the kube-apiserver.
- Stateless and can be scaled horizontally.
- Validates and processes REST requests, then updates the desired state in etcd.

For more details about [API Server deep dive](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-apiserver)

#### 2. etcd

- A highly available key-value store used as Kubernetes' single source of truth.
- Stores all cluster data: nodes, pods, secrets, configs, etc.
- Built for distributed systems with strong consistency guarantees.

ðŸ”— [What is etcd?](https://etcd.io/docs/)

#### 3. kube-scheduler

- Watches for unscheduled pods and assigns them to appropriate nodes based on:
  - Resource availability
  - Affinity/anti-affinity rules
  - Node taints/tolerations
  - Custom scheduling rules

Know more about  [Scheduling concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/)

#### 4. kube-controller-manager

- Runs all the built-in controllers as separate loops: replication controller, job controller, service account controller, etc.
- Each controller compares the desired state (from etcd) vs. the current state and makes adjustments.

ðŸ”— [Controller Manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/)

#### 5. cloud-controller-manager

- In cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure), this separates cloud-specific logic â€” like attaching volumes or provisioning load balancers â€” from the core controllers.

###  Node Components

<br/>

These components run on every worker node in the cluster and are responsible for running and managing containers.

#### 1. kubelet

The primary node agent. It:

- Talks to the kube-apiserver
- Ensures the containers are running as specified in PodSpecs
- Collects pod status and resource usage

#### 2. kube-proxy

Handles networking for Services. It:

- Sets up NAT rules using iptables or IPVS
- Routes external and internal traffic to the appropriate Pod IPs

#### 3. Container Runtime

The engine that runs containers. Kubernetes supports any CRI-compatible runtime like:

- containerd
- CRI-O
- (Previously) Docker (deprecated from v1.24)

###  Add-ons and Enhancements

<br/>

While not part of the core architecture, most production clusters include these:

- **CoreDNS** â€“ Internal DNS resolver
- **Ingress Controller** â€“ NGINX, Traefik, or cloud-based ingress for HTTP routing
- **Metrics Server** â€“ Provides CPU/memory metrics for autoscaling
- **Prometheus + Grafana** â€“ Monitoring and alerting stack
- **Dashboard** â€“ Web-based UI for the cluster

##  Kubernetes Objects (Declarative API)

The components above run the system, but what you deploy are Kubernetes objects:

| Object        | Description                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Pod           | Smallest deployable unit (one or more containers) |
| Service       | Exposes pods as network services            |
| Deployment    | Manages replica sets for stateless apps     |
| StatefulSet   | Manages stateful workloads with stable IDs  |
| DaemonSet     | Runs a pod on all (or some) nodes           |
| Job/CronJob   | Handles batch and scheduled jobs            |
| ConfigMap/Secret | Inject config or secrets into pods        |

---

##  How It All Works Together

Let's say you deploy a Deployment with kubectl:

1. You submit a YAML manifest.
2. `kubectl` sends it to the kube-apiserver.
3. kube-controller-manager notices the new deployment and creates ReplicaSets and Pods.
4. kube-scheduler picks nodes for those Pods.
5. kubelet on the nodes talks to the container runtime and starts the containers.
6. kube-proxy ensures networking is set up so traffic can reach the pod.

All this happens automatically and declaratively â€” you only specify **what** you want, not **how** to do it.

## Final Thoughts

Kubernetes is powerful because of its modular design and declarative model. Whether you're deploying a blog or scaling microservices to millions of users, the same components orchestrate it all.

Mastering these components gives you deep visibility and control over your infrastructure.
