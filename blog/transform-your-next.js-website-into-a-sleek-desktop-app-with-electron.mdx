Bringing your Next.js web project to the desktop is a smart move. Whether you want improved offline support, local data storage, or to reach users outside the browser, packaging your app as a cross-platform desktop application with familiar tech is completely possible.

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions for turning your Next.js site into a desktop app, focusing on **[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)**â€”a robust and widely-used platform for this purpose. All major links, tools, and commands are shared right where you need them.



## Why Convert Next.js to Desktop?

* **Platform reach**: Deliver your app to Windows, macOS, and Linux users.
* **Offline functionality**: Empower features that work without an internet connection.
* **Native integration**: Add desktop notifications, local file access, and system tray support.
* **No code rewrite**: Use your existing React components and Next.js logic.



## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start:

* Node.js (v18+ recommended)
* npm, Yarn, or pnpm (choose your favorite package manager)
* A working Next.js app (or use [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app))

> **Tip:** This guide uses `npm` for simplicityâ€”substitute with `yarn` or `pnpm` as needed.



## 2. Choose Your Approach: Electron or Tauri?

### ðŸ”¹ Electron

* Most popular choice for React/Next.js desktop apps
* Large ecosystem and extensive [documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest)

### ðŸ”¸ Tauri

* Smaller and secure (built with Rust)
* Produces smaller binaries
* [Tauri Documentation](https://tauri.app/)

> We'll focus on Electron for maximum compatibility but mention Tauri at the end.



## 3. Quickstart: Create Your Electronized Next.js App

You have two great paths:

### (A) From Scratch

* Create your Next.js project
* Add Electron manually

### (B) Fastest Way: Nextron

[Nextron](https://github.com/saltyshiomix/nextron) automates Electron + Next.js integration and supports TypeScript.

```bash
npx create-nextron-app my-desktop-app
# or with TypeScript:
npx create-nextron-app my-app --example with-typescript
```



## 4. Manual Integration: Adding Electron to Your Next.js Project

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

<br/>


```bash
npm install --save-dev electron electron-builder electron-is-dev
npm install electron-next
```

Packages:

* [`electron`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron)
* [`electron-builder`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-builder)
* [`electron-is-dev`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-is-dev)
* [`electron-next`](https://github.com/leo/electron-next)



### Step 2: Add the Electron Main Script

Create `electron.js` in your root:

```js
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');
const path = require('path');
const isDev = require('electron-is-dev');
const prepareRenderer = require('electron-next');

let mainWindow;

app.on('ready', async () => {
  await prepareRenderer('./renderer');
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 1280,
    height: 720,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true,
    }
  });

  const url = isDev
    ? 'http://localhost:3000'
    : `file://${path.join(__dirname, '/renderer/out/index.html')}`;

  mainWindow.loadURL(url);
});
```

More details in [electron-next](https://github.com/leo/electron-next).


### Step 3: Add Builder Configuration

Create `electron-builder.yml`:

```yml
appId: com.yourcompany.yourapp
productName: MyNextDesktopApp
directories:
  output: dist
files:
  - .next/**
  - public/**
  - electron.js
mac:
  target: dmg
  category: your.app.category
win:
  target: nsis
linux:
  target: deb
```



## 5. Adjust the Next.js Setup for Desktop

* Convert `getServerSideProps` pages to static or run a server inside Electron.
* To export statically:

```bash
npm run build
npm run export
```

* Move API logic to a Node/Express server or use Electronâ€™s [IPC](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/ipc) for native integrations.



## 6. Development Workflow

Open two terminals:

**Terminal 1: Next.js**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2: Electron**

```bash
npx electron .
# or add a command like "npm run electron"
```



## 7. Build and Package Your App

<br/>

### Step 1: Build your app

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Package using Electron Builder

```bash
npx electron-builder
# or
npm run dist
```

Final builds are in the `/dist` directory.



## 8. Extra: Nextron (Zero Config)

Nextron simplifies everything:

```bash
npx create-nextron-app my-desktop-app
cd my-desktop-app
npm run dev
```

## 9. (Alternative) Tauri: Super-Lightweight Desktop Apps

Tauri is written in Rust and produces small, secure binaries.

* [Tauri Official Site](https://tauri.app/)
* [Tauri + Next.js Guide](https://blog.aiherrera.com/easy-guide-to-create-a-desktop-app-with-nextjs-and-tauri-step-by-step)

> Tauri is a great option for advanced users or those focused on performance.


##  Pro Tips & FAQs

### Does SSR (`getServerSideProps`) work?

Only if you run a Node server inside Electron. Otherwise, use `getStaticProps` and `export`.

### What about API routes?

Use Express or move logic to the main Electron process.

### Is Electron heavy?

Yes, but it offers unmatched flexibility and native APIs.

### Is it secure?

Follow [Electronâ€™s security guidelines](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/security).



##  Conclusion

You can now turn your Next.js app into a full-featured desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux using Electron. Tools like Nextron make it even easier. Tauri is a modern alternative if size and speed are top priorities.



By following these steps, youâ€™ll enable offline support, native features, and local system integrationâ€”all with your existing Next.js codebase.

**Now itâ€™s your turnâ€”build, ship, and let users enjoy your app natively!**
