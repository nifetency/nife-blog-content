_The notion of 'Interconnection Oriented Architecture (IOA)' might feel complex for a network system, but it's a simpler approach that relies on what's previously established inside the technological base. IOA, or Interconnection Oriented Architecture, is a corporate network approach that uses WAN, LAN, and cloud technology to accelerate data transport over long distances whilst maintaining clients' security and compatibility in every way [(Chadha, 2018)]. It supports a dynamic corporate network that increases digital participation and digital transition throughout the organisation._

Function of IOA

An IOA exists at the crossroads of virtual and [physical networking] systems; it connects Lan and WAN networks to enable digital interaction at any site and place in your organisation. IOA is capable of creating a value approach that fits your company's demands and therefore can respond more swiftly in the future by leveraging most of your current communications infrastructure. Interconnection Architecture is a multi-layered networking strategy that consists of a linked set of nodes, each having its type of communication [(Wrabetz and Weaver, 2018)]. The edge nodes are constructed from four separate layers:




|  **Data**           |  **Connectivity** |
|---------------------|-------------------|
|  **Cyber Security** | **Software**      |







#### What distinguishes IOA from SOA?

As a technologically knowledgeable professional, you've certainly heard of business architecture concepts such as SOA. But what distinguishes SOA from IOA?

SOA is a software design method in which elements get resources via networking connectivity protocols. It is similar to a self BlackBox for a certain functional area. SOA in action is demonstrated through REST or representational data transfer [(Kasparick et al., 2018)]. Whereas IOA is an infrastructure development method based on Equinix colocation hub deployments. It addresses various key business issues that affect information and communication distribution.



#### Importance of IOA to businesses

Networking is essential for effective corporate administration and consumer interaction. But why is IOA superior or more significant for your organisation than some other network technologies?

In reality, IOA solves numerous essential business difficulties and offers some unique advantages that can assist your company in adapting to and embracing the digital revolution. IOA connectivity depends on the location of the user instead of the network operator; it is vastly more extensible and adaptable than typical legacy networks [(Chauhan et al., 2019)]. This is a novel approach to addressing frequent business concerns or issues confronting your IT team.



#### Advantages of 'Interconnection-Oriented Architecture (IOA)

Solving essential business challenges using IOA provides your company with a slew of new advantages, ranging from reduced latency to higher efficiency and everything else in between [(Sony, 2017)]. Whereas the advantages of IOA do not stop there, and here's a greater glance at what you may anticipate upon making the shift:


| - **Cut down on latency.**                                 | - **Encourage new economic and business developments.**     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| - **Topological Length should be reduced.**                | - **Needs of the Profession**                                 |
| - **Enhance Real-Time Decision Processing**                | - **Handle New Digital Interaction Necessitates.**            |
| - **Increase responsiveness.**                             | - **Faster innovation or quicker provision of services.**     |
| - **Reduce the possibility of security breaches or loss.** | - **Improve productivity.**                                   |
| - **Boost the overall performance of the network.**        | - **Handle Increasing Data Volume**                           |
| - **Increase Bandwidth or Utilization.**                   | - **Accommodate the Increasing Dimensionality Of the data**   |
| - **Cut your overhead expenses.**                          | - **Aggregate accessibility.**                                |
| - **Load Balance**                                         | - **Enhance QoS.**                                            |






#### What kind of enterprises should use IOA?

Whilst the IOA is useful to any business, it is most suitable for scattered or distant companies with an in-house IT team and a distinct requirement for enterprise-wide digital communication. These businesses frequently have a large amount of critical data flowing backward and forward over the networks, necessitating greater information leak prevention and GDPR conformity [(Stocker et al., 2017)]. In reality, the deployment of an IOA will assist all departments in the organization:

**Sales Division -** Interact with local sales staff and interact with potential customers throughout the engagement.

**Marketing Division -** Coordination of marketing and material distribution with the in-site and offsite personnel in various regions.

**IT Division -** Ease location configuration and activation while easily managing and maintaining data security and integrity throughout the enterprise.

**Human Capital -** Worker conformity with regulatory authorities should be evaluated and maintained.

**C-Suite -** Receive real-time information and views into key performance indicators (KPIs) to communicate with shareholders and investors [(Demchenko et al., 2015)].

#### How does IOA fit within your current infrastructure?

IOA integrates LAN and WAN for improved networking connectivity; therefore, whether you're currently utilising SD-WAN or hybrid cloud computing services, it is an incredible asset to your infrastructure. IOA may be pushed out one area at a time to guarantee ease of acceptance and to track and handle any problems in the process, simplifying your deployment plan.

### Conclusion

Your company's connection is critical. Obtaining the best of all worlds is not a huge burden for your IT staff, and neither would it have to mean sacrificing business solutions. Return control over the business connectivity to your IT team by going ahead with an IOA.
