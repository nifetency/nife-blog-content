When you're building a web or mobile app, one of the first things you’ll need is a way to let users log in securely. That’s where Amazon Cognito comes in. It helps you manage authentication without having to build everything from scratch.

In this post, we’ll break down how to use Amazon Cognito with the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow—the secure and scalable way to handle user login.

## What is Amazon Cognito?

Amazon Cognito is a user authentication and authorization service from AWS. Think of it as a toolbox for managing sign-ups, logins, and secure access to your app. Here’s what it can do:

- **Support multiple login options:** Email, phone, or social logins (Google, Facebook, Apple).
- **Manage users:** Sign-up, sign-in, and password recovery via **user pools**.
- **Access AWS services securely:** Through **identity pools**.
- **Use modern authentication:** Supports OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML.

## Why Use Amazon Cognito?

- **Scales with your app:** Handles millions of users effortlessly.
- **Secure token management:** Keeps user credentials and sessions safe.
- **Easy social logins:** No need to build separate Google/Facebook integration.
- **Customizable:** Configure user pools, password policies, and even enable MFA.
- **Tightly integrated with AWS:** Works great with API Gateway, Lambda, and S3.

It’s like plugging in a powerful login system without reinventing the wheel.

## How Amazon Cognito Works ?

![Diagram showing how Amazon Cognito User Pools and Identity Pools manage authentication and AWS access](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nifetency/nife-blog-content/main/blog/img/20945218.jpg)


Cognito is split into two parts:

### 1. User Pools
- Handles user sign-ups, sign-ins, and account recovery.
- Provides `access_token`, `id_token`, and `refresh_token` for each user session.

### 2. Identity Pools
- Assigns temporary AWS credentials to authenticated users.
- Uses IAM roles to control what each user can access.

When using OAuth 2.0, most of the action happens in the **user pool**.

## Step-by-Step: Using OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant with Cognito

![Flowchart of OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow using Amazon Cognito](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nifetency/nife-blog-content/main/blog/img/20943502.jpg)


### Step 1: Create a User Pool
1. Head over to the AWS Console and create a new **User Pool**.
2. Under App Clients, create a client and:
   - Enable **Authorization Code Grant**.
   - Set your **redirect URI** (e.g., `https://yourapp.com/callback`).
   - Choose OAuth scopes like `openid`, `email`, and `profile`.
3. Note down the **App Client ID** and **Cognito domain name**.

---

### Step 2: Redirect Users to Cognito
When someone clicks "Log In" on your app, redirect them to Cognito's OAuth2 authorize endpoint:

```
https://your-domain.auth.region.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize?
  response_type=code&
  client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
  redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&
  scope=openid+email
```

After login, Cognito will redirect back to your app with a `code` in the URL:
```
https://yourapp.com/callback?code=AUTH_CODE
```

---

### Step 3: Exchange Code for Tokens
Use the code to request tokens from Cognito:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.auth.region.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
-d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
-d "code=AUTH_CODE" \
-d "redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"
```

---

### Step 4: Use the Tokens
Once you get the tokens:

```json
{
  "access_token": "...",
  "id_token": "...",
  "refresh_token": "...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

- **access_token:** Use this to call your APIs.
- **id_token:** Contains user info like name and email.
- **refresh_token:** Helps you get new tokens when the current one expires.

Example API call:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-api.com/resource" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

---

## When to Use Authorization Code Grant?
This flow is ideal for server-side apps. It keeps sensitive data (like tokens) away from the browser, making it more secure.

---

## Why This Setup Rocks

- **Security-first:** Tokens are exchanged on the backend.
- **Scalable:** Works even if your app grows to millions of users.
- **AWS-native:** Plays nicely with other AWS services.

## Conclusion

Amazon Cognito takes the pain out of managing authentication. Combine it with OAuth 2.0’s Authorization Code Grant, and you’ve got a secure, scalable login system that just works.
