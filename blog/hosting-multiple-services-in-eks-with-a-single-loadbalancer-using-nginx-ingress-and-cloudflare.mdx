When managing Kubernetes workloads on AWS EKS, using a LoadBalancer for each service can quickly become expensive and inefficient. A cleaner, scalable, and more cost-effective solution is to use an Ingress Controller like NGINX to expose multiple services via a single LoadBalancer. This blog will walk you through how I set up Ingress in my EKS cluster using Helm, configured host-based routing, and mapped domains through Cloudflare.

---

##  Prerequisites

- AWS EKS Cluster set up
- `kubectl`, `helm`, and `aws-cli` configured
- Services already running in EKS
- Cloudflare account to manage DNS

Get started with EKS in the [AWS EKS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html).

##  Step 1: Deploy NGINX Ingress Controller using Helm

<br/>

```bash
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
helm repo update

helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
  --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace \
  --set controller.service.type=LoadBalancer
```

This will install the NGINX Ingress Controller and expose it through a LoadBalancer service. You can get the external ELB DNS using:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
```

Note the `EXTERNAL-IP` of the `nginx-ingress-controller`â€”this is your public ELB DNS.


Learn more about NGINX Ingress at the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/).

##  Step 2: Create Your Ingress YAML for Host-Based Routing

Below is an example Ingress manifest to expose a service using a custom domain:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: pubggpiro9ypjn-ing
  namespace: pubggpiro9ypjn
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: metube-app-622604.clb2.nifetency.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: service-f35714cd-4cb5-4f7e-b9db-4daa699640b3
            port:
              number: 8081
```

Apply the file using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f your-ingress.yaml
```

##  Step 3: Configure Domain in Cloudflare

<br/>

Go to your Cloudflare dashboard and create a CNAME record:

- **Name**: `metube-app-622604` (or any subdomain you want)
- **Target**: your NGINX LoadBalancer DNS (e.g., `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7.elb.amazonaws.com`)
- **Proxy status**: Proxied âœ…

Wait for DNS propagation (~1â€“5 minutes), and then your service will be available via the custom domain you configured.

Understand DNS management in Cloudflare with the [Cloudflare DNS docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/).

---

##  Verify the Setup

Try accessing the domain in your browser:

```
http://metube-app-622604.clb2.nifetency.com
```

You should see the application running from port `8081` of the backend service.

---

##  Benefits of This Setup

- **Cost-effective**: One LoadBalancer for all services.
- **Scalable**: Add new routes/domains by just updating the Ingress.
- **Secure**: Easily integrate SSL with Cert-Manager or Cloudflare.
- **Customizable**: Full control over routing, headers, and rewrites.

---

##  Conclusion

Exposing multiple services in EKS using a single LoadBalancer with NGINX Ingress can streamline your infrastructure and reduce costs. Just remember:

- Use **Helm** to install and manage the NGINX Ingress Controller
- Configure **host-based routing** to serve multiple domains through one point
- Use **Cloudflare DNS** to map custom domains to your LoadBalancer
- Regularly test and validate access for each new service

With just a few commands and configurations, you can build a scalable and efficient ingress setupâ€”ready for production.
