Cloud computing in financial sector provides institutions with the advantage to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). These technologies help financial institutions understand customer needs and incorporate changes accordingly. Cloud computing in finance also provides users with real-time information to help them make informed decisions.

All of these features combine to enhance [customer experience](/blog/cloud-computing-technologies-to-deliver-a-world-class-customer-experience/) and provide satisfaction.

### **Access to real-time data and analytics**

Cloud computing in banking sector also provides financial organizations with the advantage to access real-time information from different locations with low latency. This helps financial organizations process large chunks of financial data and transactions in seconds hence increasing the efficiency of the organization.

This feature can be utilized by financial sectors to effectively share real-time data with organizations and regulatory bodies. The response from these organizations will help implement the necessary changes in time.

### **Improved collaboration and teamwork**

Another big advantage that cloud computing in financial sector provides is improved collaboration between organizations for data sharing. These collaborations help financial institutions to perform efficient and successful financial operations, effective risk management, fraud detection, and increased efficiency of operations.

While cloud computing in financial sector provides many advantages for banks and other financial institutions. But adopting cloud computing in finance raises some concerns. Here are some of the challenges faced by the banking and financial services industry in adopting cloud technology.

### **Data privacy and security concerns**

Cloud computing in finance raises privacy and security concerns. In a cloud-based system, most of the data is stored online in cloud storage which makes it vulnerable to cyberattacks. According to a study, 44% of all cyber-attacks are on financial institutions. This makes it difficult for financial institutions like banks to shift to cloud-based solutions.

### **Cost of implementation and maintenance**

Another challenge in cloud computing for banking is a cost consideration. Most banks do not have the necessary infrastructure for cloud-based solutions. Banks process large volumes of data every day. In a cloud-based banking system, the cost depends on the amount of data processed. It will be very difficult for financial institutions to handle costs in the early stages.

### **Integration with legacy systems**

Another challenge financial institutions face while adopting cloud computing for banking is integration with legacy systems. Most financial institutions have legacy systems that are vital for their day-to-day operations. Replacing legacy systems is not an immediate option for the organization. But legacy systems can be connected to the cloud using APIs and other techniques.

### **Regulatory and compliance issues**

Banks and financial service institutions are regulated by different government bodies. These financial institutions are needed to comply with regulations by these bodies to continue their operations otherwise they may face restrictions and fines from these bodies. Cloud computing in financial sector makes it hard for financial institutions to comply with these regulations.

Most of the time it is required for these companies to store data at a specific place which is not possible in cloud-based systems. Sometimes it is also required for financial institutions to give access to information to only certain persons but in cloud-based systems it is required to give access to multiple developers to maintain stability.

## **Case Studies of Cloud Technology Adoption in the Banking and Financial Services Industry**

Here are some case studies of financial institutes that have adopted cloud computing technology. These financial organizations have properly leveraged cloud technology to scale their operations. Have a look at all these organizations to have a better understanding of the impact.

### **JPMorgan Chase**
