Welcome back to our ongoing exploration! Today we'll be exploring containers and container orchestration with Kubernetes.

Container Orchestration platforms have become a crucial aspect of DevOps in modern software development. They bring agility, automation and efficiency.

Before going deep into the topic let's understand some critical concepts and get familiar with some key terms. Whether you are a DevOps pro or a newbie, this journey will help you understand and harness the power of these technologies for faster and more reliable software delivery.

Before moving on to Kubernetes let's first understand the concept of containers.

## **What are containers?**

Containers are lightweight executable packages that confine an application with all the dependencies ( code, libraries, tools, etc.), crucial for the application's functioning. Containers provide a consistent environment for the software for deployment and testing.

Containers ensure your application runs smoothly regardless of the device and environment. Containers bring predictability and reliability to the software development process. That's why they've become a crucial part of the modern software development landscape.

Now that you've understood the concept of containers. It's time to turn our attention to container orchestration and Kubernetes.

## **What is Container Orchestration?**

Container orchestration is the management and automation of your containerized applications. As you scale, the management of containers across platforms becomes very difficult manually. This is where container orchestration comes into the picture.

To fully grasp the concept of container orchestration. Here are some key aspects.

**Deployment:** Container orchestration tools allow you to deploy and manage your container as you need. You can select the number of instances and resources for your container.

**Scaling:** Orchestration tools automatically manage the workloads and scale up and down whenever needed. Different metrics are analyzed for scaling which include CPU usage, traffic, etc.

**Service Discovery: **Orchestration tools provide mechanisms that enable communication between containers. This communication is critical, especially in a microservices architecture.

**Load balancing: **Load balancing is also a crucial aspect. Orchestration tools balance the load by distributing all incoming requests across container instances. This optimizes the application's performance and ensures availability.

**Health Monitoring: **Container orchestration tools ensure continuous monitoring of containers' health. Different metrics are monitored in real-time to ensure proper functioning. In case of any failure, containers are automatically replaced.

Now that you've understood the concept of containers and got familiar with container orchestration. Let's explore Kubernetes.

Let's start with some basics and background.

## **Kubernetes Overview:**

Kubernetes also abbreviated as k8s is an open-source container orchestration platform that helps developers manage, scale, and deploy their containerized applications efficiently and reliably. After the rise of containerization in the software development world developers felt the need for a container management platform.

Despite the containers' benefits, managing them manually was a tedious task. As a result, a gap in the market was created. This gap led to the birth of Kubernetes from Google's Internal container management system. Kubernetes made container orchestration efficient and more reliable by bringing automation into it.

As soon as it was released, it spread like wildfire throughout the industry. Organizations adopted Kubernetes for efficient container orchestration.

You've got an overview of Kubernetes. Now let's explore its components.

**Kubernetes Architecture:**

It's important to explore Kubernetes architecture to understand how Kubernetes manage, scale, and deploy containers behind the scenes. Kubernetes workload is distributed between master nodes and worker nodes.

You might be wondering what are master nodes and worker nodes.

Master nodes handle the bigger picture in the cluster and act as the brains of the architecture. It includes components like the API server, etcd, the scheduler, and the controller manager.

Worker nodes handle the workload in the Kubernetes cluster and act as hands of the architecture. It includes kubelet, container runtime, and kube-proxy.

Now let's explore these master and worker nodes.

### **Master Nodes:**

**API Servers: **API servers are the centre point of the Kubernetes control plane. It receives all the requests from users and applications and gives instructions. It's the point of contact in the Kubernetes cluster.

**Etcd: **Think of it as the memory keeper of the cluster. It stores important information related to the cluster like configurations and metadata. Its consistent distribution nature is essential to maintain the desired state of the cluster.

**Scheduler: **It's a matchmaker. It matches pods with worker nodes based on resource requirements and constraints. By doing so scheduler optimized resource utilization.

**Controller Manager: **It manages the state of your cluster. The controller manager has ReplicaSets and deployment controllers at its disposal to ensure pods and other resources align with your specifications. The controller manager ensures that the actual state of your cluster matches the desired state.

### **Worker Nodes:**

**Kubelet: **Kubelet manages the worker nodes and communicates with the API server on the condition of pods. It ensures containers in pods are running in the desired state. It also reports different metrics like resource usage and node's status back to the control plane.

**Container Runtime: **Container runtime runs containers inside pods. Kubernetes supports various container run times. One of the most popular container runtimes is docker and Kubernetes supports it, which launches and manages containers.

**Kube Proxy: **Kube proxy allows network communication between different resources. It enables pods to communicate with each other and external resources.

Now that you've become familiar with Kubernetes architecture, you can understand the Kubernetes ecosystem easily, Kubernetes manages containerized applications and handles scaling.

## **Kubernetes Ecosystem:**

Kubernetes ecosystem consists of a vast collection of tools, resources, and projects. These components enhance the capabilities of Kubernetes. As Kubernetes is open source, it evolves continuously due to the contribution of developers.

Here are some components of the ecosystem:

**Kubectl and Kubeconfig: **These are the most important commands in Kubernetes. **Kubectl** allows you to manage resources and deploy applications while **Kubeconfig **allows you to configure files stored in the cluster.

**Helm: **It is a package manager in Kubernetes. It allows you to manage complex applications. You can define different application components and configurations with Helm.

**Operators: **These are customer controllers that enhance Kubernetes functionality. They use custom resources to manage complex applications and services in Kubernetes.

There are also other components of the Kubernetes ecosystem which include, CI/CD pipelines, Networking solutions, storage solutions, security solutions, and many more.

That's all for today. Hope you've understood the concept of containerization and role of Kubernetes in orchestration. With its architecture and ecosystem, Kubernetes enhances scalability, fault tolerance, automation, and resource utilization.
