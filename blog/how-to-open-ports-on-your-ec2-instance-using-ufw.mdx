If you've ever worked with AWS EC2 instances, you know that keeping your instance secure is crucial. One way to do this is by managing your firewall, and in this blog post, well go over how to configure **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** on your EC2 instance to allow specific ports—like **SSH (port 22), MySQL (port 3306), and HTTP (port 80)**—so you can connect to your instance and run services smoothly.

## Why Use UFW?

On Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems, UFW is a straightforward command-line interface for controlling firewall rules.  Because it is easy to set up and still provides a high degree of security, it is ideal for EC2 instances.  Allowing the traffic you require while keeping unnecessary ports open to the internet is the aim here.

## Prerequisites
Before diving in, make sure:
- Your EC2 instance is running Ubuntu or another Debian-based Linux distribution.
- You have **SSH access** to the instance.
- UFW is installed (well check and install it if necessary).

## Step-by-Step Guide to Open Ports

### 1. Check if UFW is Installed
First, let's check if UFW is installed on your EC2 instance. Connect to your EC2 instance and run:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

If UFW is not installed, the command will return:

```bash
ufw: command not found
```

In that case, install it with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw
```

### 2. Allow Specific Ports
Now, let's open the ports you need:

```bash
# Allow SSH (port 22)
sudo ufw allow 22

# Allow MySQL (port 3306)
sudo ufw allow 3306

# Allow HTTP (port 80)
sudo ufw allow 80
```

These commands let traffic through on the specified ports, ensuring smooth access to your instance.

### 3. Enable UFW
If UFW is not already enabled, activate it by running:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

To verify, check the status:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

You should see:

```plaintext
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22                         ALLOW       Anywhere
3306                       ALLOW       Anywhere
80                         ALLOW       Anywhere
```

### 4. Optional: Restrict Access to Specific IPs
You may want to restrict access to particular IPs for extra security.  For instance, to only permit SSH from your IP:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.0 to any port 22
```

You can do the same for MySQL and HTTP:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.0 to any port 3306
sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.0 to any port 80
```

This adds an extra layer of security by preventing unwanted access.

### 5. Verify Your Firewall Rules
Run the following command to check active rules:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

This confirms which ports are open and from which IPs they can be accessed.

<br/>

### Can't Connect via SSH?
If you cant connect to your EC2 instance via SSH after enabling UFW, make sure **port 22** is open:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22
```

Also, check your **AWS Security Group settings** and ensure SSH is allowed. You can review AWS security group rules [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules.html).

### Can't Connect to MySQL?
Ensure **port 3306** is open and verify that your database allows remote connections.

### Web Traffic Not Reaching the Instance?
Check if **port 80** is open and confirm that your EC2 **security group** allows inbound HTTP traffic.

## Conclusion
You now know how to use UFW to open particular ports on your EC2 instance, enabling HTTP, MySQL, and SSH communication while restricting access to unwanted ports.  This keeps your server safe while guaranteeing that critical services run correctly.
