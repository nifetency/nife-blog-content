# Overview of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Cloud Management Platforms

Gartner is a research and advisory firm that publishes reports on technology to help businesses make informed decisions. Magic Quadrant is one of the most popular and useful tools by Gartner. Gartner's analysts conduct extensive research on cloud platforms to identify key players. They gather information from vendor briefings, customer feedback, and product demonstrations. Gartner evaluates a platform based on many factors including scalability, ease of use, features, security, performance, market presence, and integration with other services. Gartner also takes into account other important metrics like pricing models, customer satisfaction, and vendor support.

After evaluation, cloud management platform vendors are divided into 4 categories based on their execution and completeness of vision. These categories are leaders, challengers, visionaries, and niche players. Being positioned as a leader in Gartner Magic Quadrant is like receiving an award. It signifies that the vendor has a clear vision and ability to execute it. Magic Quadrant guides businesses in their quest of finding a suitable cloud management platform for their business.

### Implications for Vendors and Buyers

The changes and updates in the latest version of the Magic Quadrant for CMPs have implications for both vendors and buyers.

Due to the inclusion of emerging technologies and trends, there have been some shifts in the positioning of various vendors in the magic quadrant. Some vendors have completely dropped out from the magic quadrant while others have improved their positioning. Microsoft Azure, for instance, has improved its position from challenger to leader in the quadrant while Embotics has slipped from leader quadrant to visionary over the years due to a lack of adaptability. Microsoft has a clear vision and has the ability to deliver on its vision. Moreover, it supports multi-cloud and has automation and governance capabilities. These changes in vendor positioning indicate the importance of adapting to changing market needs.
