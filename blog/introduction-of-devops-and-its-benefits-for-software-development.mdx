When it comes down to it, the essence of DevOps is working culture. It encompasses a range of techniques and approaches that encourage collaboration between software developers and IT operations teams. The aim is to eliminate barriers between the two groups and promote a shared vision. DevOps helps to overcome the challenges posed by communication breakdowns between development and IT operations by fostering a more integrated approach. In this article, we will discuss DevOps and what benefits we get from using DevOps.

# **DevOps- Overview**

The idea of bringing development and IT operations together emerged in the late 2000s when experts from both fields realized that the traditional approach was no longer effective. Previously, developers would write code independently, while IT staff would deploy and support the code without much collaboration. To address this issue, a new approach was developed that integrated both parts of the process into a seamless, continuous activity.

Today, the meaning of DevOps has expanded to encompass the entire product life cycle. DevOps is a combination of two different words "development" and "operations". It refers to a set of practices and tools to boost an organization's efficiency in [delivering applications and services faster](/blog/how-can-5g-connections-deliver-100times-faster-and-monetize/) than conventional software development methods. It's not just about speedily creating and having software but also about improving the quality of the product through close collaboration between teams. This collaboration leads to not only a higher-quality product when it is deployed but also better support and maintenance over its lifetime.

## **How does DevOps work?**

A [DevOps team collaborates](/blog/optimize-ops-resources-by-collaborating-with-an-extended-devops-platform/) with developers and IT operations to improve software deployment speed and quality. It represents a cultural shift in the work approach. DevOps eliminates the division between dev and ops teams, often resulting in a single, multiskilled team covering the entire application lifecycle. Tools are used in DevOps to automate and streamline processes, leading to increased reliability. A DevOps toolchain supports continuous integration, delivery, automation, and collaboration. The DevOps approach is not limited to development teams and can also be applied to security teams, resulting in [DevSecOps](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/devsecops.html#:~:text=DevSecOps%20(short%20for%20development%2C%20security,deliver%20robust%20and%20secure%20applications.), where security is integrated into the development process.

## **What does DevOps do?**

DevOps focuses on bringing cross-functional teams together and utilizing automated tools to streamline the software development process. It aims to reduce development cycles and establish a seamless and efficient workflow. The principles of Agile methodology are central to DevOps, with a strong emphasis on automation, collaboration, and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). CI/CD is crucial in ensuring that all working copies of code written by different developers are merged into a single main branch (also known as the main branch) through pull requests and code review. This combined code is tested and validated before being pushed to the production environment.

Continuous Deployment (CD) is a key component of DevOps, as it encourages regular and frequent deployments, requiring the involvement of Quality Assurance (QA) engineers. CD aligns with the idea of working in development sprints, which are time-bound development tasks within the Scrum framework that adhere to Agile workflows. DevOps, built on Agile principles, seamlessly integrates these practices. It is important to understand that these practices are interrelated and should not be viewed in isolation. For instance, the "Ops" aspect of DevOps can also be connected to the concept of IT Service Management (ITSM).

Understanding DevOps is only one aspect of the larger [digital transformation](/blog/digital-transformation-ways-bfsi-can-thrive-in-dynamic-technological-advancements/) journey.

## **Key purpose of DevOps?**

DevOps encompasses several aspects, with automation and security being of particular significance. Despite being widely discussed, security is often neglected in practice. By doing so, the product's security standards and vulnerability protection can be maintained from day one, ensuring its integrity over time. Integration of security features can be achieved on-premise, through [cloud computing](/blog/what-are-cloud-computing-servicesiaas-caas-paas-faas-saas/), or a combination of both, and supports the use of automation tools and features.

Software is no longer just a supporting element for businesses but a critical component that drives operations internally and externally. The software has become crucial to efficient logistics and communication with the widespread use of online services, platforms, and applications in our daily lives. The value of products and services can be greatly diminished without properly functioning the software.

### **Better performance of software**

DevOps principles play a vital role in ensuring the optimal performance of the software by fostering collaboration and cooperation between development and IT operations teams, through implementing best practices and using advanced technologies.

### **Time-saving and efficient**

DevOps has reduced the friction between these teams and streamlined the work process. This leads to better collaboration, shared responsibilities, and a common goal, ultimately saving time and increasing efficiency.

### **Reduced Time-to-Market**

DevOps facilitates teams to work efficiently through its principles and best practices, leading to faster company growth and scaling. This results in regular presentation of significant outcomes to customers, higher quality, and stable software.

### **Iterative Enhancements**

Continuous feedback eliminates guesswork, allowing DevOps teams to identify what is liked and what needs to be changed in the software. These modifications are implemented promptly but in small sequences, avoiding excessive workloads and preventing burnout.

Constant and consistent deployments enhance the product rapidly, providing a significant competitive advantage.

### **Improved Reliability**

The step-by-step approach of DevOps workflows minimizes the risk of bugs, increasing confidence in the software's functionality. This results in greater trust among end-users and generates positive word-of-mouth marketing.

### **Scalability Possibilities**

DevOps's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows infrastructure and development to be managed at scale, simplifying complex and layered systems through automation. Risks are reduced, and processes become more transparent.

## **Conclusion**

DevOps is revolutionizing the way development and operations are currently being conducted. By adopting the DevOps philosophy, practices, processes, frameworks, and workflows, organizations can build security into their software development life cycle quickly and on a large scale while maintaining safety. DevOps enables development, operations, and security teams to find a balance between the speed of delivery and security/compliance and integrate security into the entire software development life cycle (SDLC). This helps to minimize risks, ensure compliance, reduce friction and costs, and provide a secure software delivery pipeline.
