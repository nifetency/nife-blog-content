### **Computer Vision and Edge Computing**

Before jumping into the topic let's explore [cloud vision technology and edge computing](/blog/what-is-edge-to-cloud-cloud-computing-security/) in detail.

### What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a field of AI (Artificial Intelligence) that enables machines to interpret and analyze visual data (images and videos) intelligently. It uses different algorithms, machine learning, and deep neural networks for that.

In the last few years, it has improved very much in capabilities. It has various applications in different fields. Some computer vision applications are facial recognition, object detection, and self-driving vehicles.

### What is Edge Computing?

Edge computing is a type of cloud computing that uses IoT devices to process data closer to the source of its generation. It provides many benefits including low latency, high bandwidth, high speed, reliability, and security. It reduces the dependence on a centralized cloud solution.

The advantages of deploying computer vision solutions with edge computing can not be denied. But there are also some challenges and concerns that need to be addressed. These challenges include security and privacy concerns, power constraints, latency and bandwidth issues, and security.

#### **Latency and Bandwidth Issues**

One of the important challenges in the deployment of computer vision solutions with edge computing is latency and bandwidth issues. Data is processed at the edge of the network, close to the source in edge computing. The processing capabilities of edge devices are limited and computer vision applications usually require a large amount of processing power.

This may increase the latency of the speed and affect the real-time decision-making capabilities. However, this problem can be resolved by selectively sending data to the cloud for low latency.

#### **Security and Privacy Concerns**

Edge computing infrastructure involves the deployment of multiple connected devices. These devices are deployed in an unsafe environment and are always vulnerable to cyber attacks. Important data collected by these devices can be compromised. These security and privacy concerns can be addressed by using encryptions and access controls.

#### **Power Constraints**

Edge devices usually have limited battery capacities. These batteries can dry up pretty quickly during the processing of vast amounts of data. In that case, it can create operational challenges. It is important to take necessary actions to avoid these types of problems.

#### **Scalability**

Another big challenge in the deployment of computer vision applications is [scalability](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/scalability). As processing requirements of computer vision applications are huge. To fulfill these processing requirements, a large number of edge devices are required. It can be difficult to manage these large numbers of devices which can eventually create scalability challenges.

### **Strategies for Efficient Deployment of Computer Vision Solutions with Edge Computing**

Efficient deployment of computer vision solutions with edge computing can be done by implementing some useful strategies. Here are some of the strategies that can be used to improve efficiency.

#### **Edge Device Selection**

Choosing edge devices is a very important strategy in deploying computer vision solutions. Edge devices need to be selected based on capabilities such as processing power, battery, memory, connectivity, and reliability. Computer vision deployment requires the processing of vast amounts and latency for real-time decision-making. That is why it is crucial to select devices carefully.

#### **Machine Learning Models and Algorithms**

Machine learning models and algorithms play a crucial role in the efficient deployment of computer vision solutions. Edge devices are not capable of processing these language models and algorithms. Therefore lightweight language models and algorithms can be used for speed and accuracy. These lightweight models deliver without compromising quality.

#### **Cloud Edge Hybrid Solutions**

Another important strategy for the deployment of Computer Vision solutions with edge computing is the use of hybrid solutions. Computer vision applications require large storage and processing power. By implementing hybrid solutions these needs can be addressed efficiently. Organizations can use cloud resources for important data while day-to-day processing edge devices can be used. Hybrid infrastructure provides security, reliability, and speed.

### **Use Cases:**
