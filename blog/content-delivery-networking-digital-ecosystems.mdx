_Presently, the success of a company entails engaging in digitalization to penetrate market opportunities, connect with consumers in unusual ways, and discover different methods and practices. This entails reversing the conventional corporate model—moving from one that would be compartmentalized and rigid to one that is interconnected and fluid._

_Owing to enhanced digital ecosystems which thus offer all-new levels of economic development and return on investment, new types of digital business dialogue and integration (open interconnection) are now conceivable. Because, in the digital era, big players have the finest virtual connectivity, wherein they collect and administer the broadest ecosystem of brand and product suppliers [(Park, Chung and Shin, 2018)]. Digital Ecosystem Management (DEM) is a new business field that has arisen in reaction to digitalization and digital ecosystem connectivity._

### **Significance of digital ecosystems**

Networking impacts are introduced by [digital ecosystems]. Businesses that integrate with virtualization can create configurable business strategies comprised of adaptable programs and services that can be readily changed out when market demands and/or new technologies dictate [(Hoch and Brad, 2020)]. Implementation of change (like the worldwide COVID-19 epidemic) isn't any more the same as plotting a new path on a cruise liner. Businesses may now react instantly, more accurately, and at a cheaper price than it has ever been.

However, like with any radical transformation, appropriate execution is critical to gaining a competitive edge. Businesses must first select how they want to engage in any particular ecosystem. Instigators define the ecosystem's settings and optimize its worth. Contributors offer assistance through a wide range of commercial formats (service, channel, etc.) and create secondary interconnections. Irrespective of the purpose, each organization must understand its fundamental capabilities and enable other ecosystem participants to produce higher value than would be achievable all alone at mass.

### **A triad of digital ecosystems**

Every ecosystem contains a variety of people who play distinct yet interrelated and interdependent functions. Presently, there are three fundamental forms of digital ecosystems:

#### **Platform ecosystem**

Businesses that manufacture and sell equipment comprise a platform ecosystem. Networking, memory, and computing are examples of digital fundamental building blocks, as are [digital solutions](https://docs.nife.io/) and/or products.

#### **Collaboration ecosystem**

A collaborative ecosystem is a group of businesses that focus on data, AI, machine learning, and the exchange of knowledge to create new businesses or solve complicated challenges [(Keselman et al., 2019)].

#### **Services ecosystem**

A services ecosystem is one in which businesses supply certain business operations and make those activities accessible to other businesses as a service. This enables businesses to build new involved in supply chain models, improving their particular company's operations.

### **Emerging Digital ecosystem models**

The three unique digital ecosystems spanning multiple sectors include different marketplaces. Businesses from many sectors team up to engage in professional contact events, resulting in the formation of new ecosystem models. Independent retail, economic service, transportation, and logistics ecosystems, for example, are collaborating to establish a new digital ecosystem to generate more effective, value-added distribution networks [(Morgan-Thomas, Dessart and Veloutsou, 2020)].

### **Best practices in the digital ecosystem**

Businesses must stay adaptable when developing an integrated digital ecosystem. The goal of digital transformation is to remodel an organization's goods, processes, and strengths utilizing contemporary technology [(Gasser, 2015)]. This rethinking cannot take place unless the organization is ready to accept all of the prospective changes. Effective digital ecosystems have the following best practices:

- The business model is being rethought.
- Promoting an open, collaborative culture.
- Bringing together a varied group of partners.
- Create a large user base.
- Make a significant worldwide impact.
- Maintain your technological knowledge.

### **Gravity and network density of Digital Ecosystem**

Digital ecosystems have a gravitational pull and attract additional members. This increases network connectivity between interconnected ecosystems and data center customers. The removal of the range component eliminates or considerably reduces transmission delay, instability, and errors. Businesses may interface with partner organizations instantly and safely by employing one-to-many software-defined connectivity, such as Equinix FabricTM [(Marzuki and Newell, 2019)].

Interconnectivity changes the dynamics of information and correspondence time. It's the most effective way of getting enormous amounts of data and communication between an expanding number of participants—while maintaining the minimum delay, fastest bandwidth, highest dependability, and fastest connection delivery. And, because all of those linkages are private rather than public, as with the network, the likelihood of cybersecurity threats interrupting any specific ecosystem is much reduced.

**Conclusion**

Digital ecosystems are a crucial aspect of doing business in the current online market. The breadth of digital ecosystems is fluid, encompassing a wide variety of products, activities, infrastructures, and applications. As a business progresses from the adaptor to attacker, its effect and worth in the digital ecosystem expand from the business level to the ecosystem level. As with any management framework, businesses must change themself in the first phase before reforming their sector and ecosystem in the final phase.
