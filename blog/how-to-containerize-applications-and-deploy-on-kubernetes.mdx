Containerization is a revolutionary approach to application deployment. It allows developers to pack an application with all its dependencies in an isolated container. These containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained. They act as a mini-universe and provide a consistent environment regardless of the underlying infrastructure. Containerization eliminates the infamous "it works only on my device"

Containerization ensures applications run consistently from the development laptop to the server. Containerization provides many benefits which include deployment simplicity, scalability, security, and efficiency. Kubernetes is a popular container orchestration platform developed by Google. It provides various tools for automating container deployments.

In this article, we will explore the world of containerization and how Kubernetes takes the concept to the next level. We will introduce Nife Labs, a leading cloud computing platform that offers automated containerization workflows, solving the challenges of deployment, scaling, and management. Read the full article for valuable insights.

## Understanding Deployment on Kubernetes

Kubernetes has its infrastructure to ensure everything runs seamlessly. At the core of Kubernetes exists a master node, which controls everything. The master node is responsible for orchestrating the activities of worker nodes and overseeing the entire cluster. Master nodes act as a conductor, they communicate, manage, deploy, and [scale applications](/blog/challenges-faced-by-financial-services-while-scaling-application/) inside a container.

Worker nodes are the actual containers that host the applications. These nodes provide all the necessary resources to ensure that the application runs smoothly. These nodes communicate through a cluster network. The cluster network plays a crucial role in ensuring the distributed nature of the applications running on Kubernetes.

### Some Key concepts in Kubernetes

Before moving toward the steps of containerization and deployment on Kubernetes. It is important to get familiar with some key concepts of the Kubernetes ecosystem.

1. **Pods: **Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes is called a pod. It represents a group of one or more containers that are tightly coupled and share the same resources, such as storage volumes and network namespace. Pods enable containers to work together and communicate effectively within the cluster.

2. **Deployments:** It defines the desired state of pods that should be running at a specific time. Deployment enables scaling and rollout of new features. It also ensures the application is in perfect condition all the time.

3. **Services**: Services provide a stable route for accessing pods. They provide an easy path for clients to access pode instead of complex pod IPs. They make applications available and scalable.

4. **Replication Controllers: **Replication controllers ensure the applications are available and fault tolerant. They created desired replicas of pods so they keep running in the cluster. They maintain the health of the pod and manage the life cycle of replicas.

## Preparing Your Application for Containerization

The first step in containerization is preparing your application for containerization. Preparation of containerization consists of three steps which include assessing application requirements and dependencies, Modularizing and decoupling application components, and Configuring the application for containerization.

### Assessing Application Requirements and Dependencies

It is an important step to determine the necessary components to include in the container. Assess the dependencies of your application. Identify all hardware and software requirements. Make sure to identify all the external dependencies. It will help identify the necessary components to add to the container.

### Modularizing and Decoupling Application Components

Once you have identified all the dependencies of your application, now is the time to divide your application into smaller manageable microservices. Your application consists of several services working together. Breaking down allows for easier scalability, containerization, development, and deployment.

### Configuring the Application

Once you have broken down your application into microservices. It is now time to configure it for containerization.

**Defining containerization boundaries: **Identify all the components that will run in different containers and make sure each microservice works independently. Define clear boundaries of your container.

**Packaging the application into container images:** The container image contains all the necessary components to run your application. Create Dockerfiles or container build specifications that specify the steps to build the container images. Include the required dependencies, libraries, and configurations within these images.

## Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster

The next phase is setting up Kubernetes clusters. It requires careful planning and coordination. Below are the steps for setting up Kubernetes clusters.

### Choosing a Kubernetes deployment model

Kubernetes offer different [deployment models](/blog/cloud-deployment-models-and-its-types/) based on the unique needs of businesses. It offers On-premise, cloud, and hybrid deployment models.

1. **On-Premise Deployment: **On-premise, Kubernetes cluster can be installed on your physical device. It provides complete security and control over resources.

2. **Cloud Deployment: **Cloud platforms provide Kubernetes services. Some examples of these services are Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). They simplify cluster management and provide efficiency, high availability, and automated updates.

3. **Hybrid deployment:** Kubernetes also offers a hybrid deployment environment where the Kubernetes cluster spans different environments and ensures a consistent experience across all devices.

### Installing and configuring the Kubernetes cluster

Here are the steps involved in installing and configuring the Kubernetes cluster.

1. **Setting Up Master Node:** As we discussed earlier master nodes control the entire cluster. Install Kubernetes control panel components to manage and orchestrate the cluster.

- **Adding Worker Nodes: **Adding working nodes to your cluster is important because they contain applications and their dependencies. Ensure worker nodes are connected to master nodes.

- **Configuring networking and storage:** Kubernetes relies on communication for effective containerization. Configure the network and set up storage that ensures high availability and accessibility.

## Deploying Containerized Applications on Kubernetes

In this phase, you will deploy your containerized applications on Kubernetes. We will explore each step of application deployment.

### Defining Kubernetes Manifests

It is important to define manifest and deployment specifications before the deployment of an application on Kubernetes. Kubernetes manifest is a file that contains all the resources needed for the proper functionality of your application. Whereas deployment ensures all the necessary pods are running at a point in time.

### Deploying Applications

Once you have all the resources that are needed for containerization. It is time to deploy the application. Let's explore the key deployment steps.

First of all, create pods to containerize the applications with their dependencies. Make sure all the resources are allocated. Now create deployments to manage the lifecycle of your applications. Lastly, create services to ensure effective communication of your application.

Once your application is deployed and the demand for your application increases. It is time to adjust the replica count in the deployment specification. Also, implement rollout and rollback features. Rolling out updates with new features and bug fixes allows you to keep your application up to date while maintaining the availability of your application. While rollback allows you to safely switch to the previous version of your application in case of instability.

## Managing and Monitoring Containerized Applications

Managing and monitoring your application is an important part of containerization. It is crucial for their stability, performance, and overall success. In this section, we will explore important aspects of managing and monitoring your containerized application.

### Monitoring Performance and Resource Utilization

Monitoring performance and resource utilization gives important information about your application. Kubernetes have built-in metric collections which can be visualized using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. Monitoring CPU usage, memory consumption, and network traffic gives valuable insights into the application.

### Implementing Logging and Debugging

Implementing a central logging system offers transparency in the application and provides valuable information regarding problems. Tools like Fluentd or Elasticsearch can be used for collecting logging data. Moreover, Kubernetes offers many tools that use logging data for debugging.
