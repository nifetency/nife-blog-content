_Modern tech in customer support, assistance, and business is generating a lot of buzz. The majority of new technology will only assist customer-facing workers to accomplish their tasks more efficiently. Cloud computing technology, cloud-native application development, Edge Computing for Enterprises, multimedia, real-time messaging, chatbots, and artificial intelligence (AI), cryptocurrency, and even self-service, itself all have the potential to deliver a world-class customer experience._

How [Cloud computing technology](/blog/5g-in-healthcare-technology-nife-cloud-computing-platform/) is Transforming Customer Experience?

Retail, healthcare, finance, and manufacturing are all industries that generate massive volumes of data daily. To truly exploit this data, you must first store and analyse it, something traditional data solutions are incapable of doing owing to their fragmented nature.

Cloud computing technologies are a means to many goals that each organisation must identify as part of a unified cloud strategy. There are several ways that Cloud computing technology may have a real-world influence across industries for companies aiming to change the customer experience. The banking, insurance, and healthcare industries all generate massive amounts of data, have regulatory compliance requirements, and have high client demand for services and goods [(Deb, Jain and Deb, 2018)]. They require strategies to provide, track, expand, and enhance such services while also meeting consumers' financial and healthcare demands.

Cloud computing technology is critical to reaching this aim since it provides:

### Analytics and data processing

### Compliance with regulatory data protection requirements

### Detection of Fraud

### Elimination of mainframe technological debt through cloud-native app integration

### Loan processing and underwriting examination

### New banking and financial planning goods and services

### Inventory control

What Edge Computing for Enterprises means for the Customer Experience?

Processing data at the source rather than a centralized or cloud-based server may appear to be a technical problem, but Edge computing for enterprises only benefits marketers. Marketers can participate in the following activities with data processing occurring closer to the source:

#### Real-time marketing:

Because data is analyzed at the source, marketers may create automated systems that respond promptly to customer inputs by using [Edge computing](/blog/what-is-5g-telco-edge-telco-edge-computing/) for enterprises

#### Offline experiences:

Edge computing for enterprises isn't entirely dependent on a connection between an IoT device and a centralized server, actions can be carried out even when no internet connection is available [(Noghabi et al., 2020)].

#### Personalization and interactive experiences:

Edge computing for enterprises will be able to react quickly to consumer involvement, resulting in a hyper-personalized experience defined and controlled by the end user.

Cloud-native Software Development for customer experience

To survive the upheaval, businesses need to have access to highly qualified workers, a strong infrastructure, and the flexibility to create high-quality apps. Organizations must embrace new technologies such as DevOps, Agile, microservices, containers, Agile, and platform-as-a-service to implement contemporary techniques such as provisioning, automated testing, and cloud-native application development to thrive in today's digital edge [(Kosińska and Zieliński, 2020)].

Today's businesses rely heavily on software to differentiate their service and product offerings. Businesses are shifting to design such apps for the best performance in the cloud to take advantage of the flexibility and speed of the cloud. As a result, an early user of cloud-native apps has enjoyed exceptional business velocity and growth. Cloud-native Software Development enables companies to fully realize the promise of cloud-native capabilities to achieve maximum speed, agility, and DevOps efficiency and fully embrace the true benefits of Cloud-native Software Development.

How can the latest technologies assist businesses in improving the customer experience?

Understanding customer behaviour is critical for any corporation seeking to become a market leader in today's volatile business environment. Customer experience management may be time-consuming and costly, and it generally necessitates uniformity across channels, such as closed-loop procedures, customer service centre encounters, SMS, website engagement, and so on [(Gellweiler, and Krishnamurthi, 2020)].

Companies are focused on automation and uncovering an organization's latent potential with the assistance of Cloud computing technology, Cloud-native Software Development, and Edge computing for enterprises in the following ways to further simplify these operations and have a direct influence on customers:

### Effective business strategy optimization

In today's fast-paced business world, tapping into uncharted territory might be one of the things that firms can use to ensure long-term success.

#### Data gathering and review generation

Businesses must be agile and responsive in their procedures to adapt to today's fast-paced business climate.

#### Recommendations customized to you.

With the use of AI and sophisticated data analytics in the business domain, predictive analytics tools may assist businesses in producing informed forecasts by providing wiser ideas and intelligent recommendations for future data-driven strategy creation [(Rekettye and Rekettye, 2019)].

#### Technology that brings customers closer together.

AI is the market's next big thing and for all the right reasons. Or perhaps technology has already become an important part of our life without our recognizing it. With a fantastic customer-centric strategy, any firm hopes to generate revenue at the end of the day.
